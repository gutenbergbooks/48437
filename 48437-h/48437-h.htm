<p class="caption2">PREFACE</p>


<p>Notwithstanding the large number of books, both
ancient and modern, which have been written on the art
of Hawking, it cannot be said that the English-speaking people
generally have more than a very vague idea of the character of
the sport, or the mode in which it was, and still is, conducted.</p>

<p>Yet, in an experience of Hawking which extends over more
than thirty years, the author has found that a great and increasing
curiosity, and even a real interest in the subject, prevails,
especially amongst sporting men, who are in many notable
instances beginning to believe that hawks and their owners
have been unduly disparaged, and that there is more to be
said in their favour than has for the last two centuries been
imagined.</p>

<p>There has not been space in this volume to discuss the much-vexed
question how far the use of hawks is compatible with the
preservation of game. But it may be said here, without any
reservation, that wherever experiments have been actually tried,
Hawking has been found not to spoil but to improve the shooting.</p>

<p>The object of the author has been to describe as briefly as
was consistent with clearness the birds now chiefly used in the
chase, and the manner of training and flying them. His hope
is that some of the sportsmen who read these pages may, in
spite of the difficulties which they will have to encounter, resolve
to give this old and honourable sport a trial.</p>

<p>The use of technical terms has been avoided as far as
possible; and those which could not be excluded have been
explained in the text. When the reader is puzzled by any
word, a reference to the Index will direct him to the page where
the meaning of it is given.</p>

<p>IT would be easy to fill a large volume with dissertations on
the antiquity of the art which is now called Falconry, and
with records of its history in different countries during the
many centuries that have elapsed since it was first practised.
In a treatise on practical hawking, such as the present, there is
no room for such matter; and the omission will be the more
readily excused when it is explained that only a short time
ago the antiquities of the art, and the literature in which its
records are embodied, were most carefully and ably explored
by Mr. J. E. Harting, the erudite Secretary of the Linnean
Society, whose catalogue of books on hawking contains a reference
to every known publication on the subject (<i>Bibliotheca
Accipitraria</i>, London, 1891). The actual origin of hawking, as
of other old sports, is naturally hidden in the obscurity of the
far-away past. No one would suppose that it was practised as
early in the world&rsquo;s history as the sister sports of hunting and
fishing. But Mr. Harting&rsquo;s researches have resulted in convincing
him that it was known at least as early as 400 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
although its introduction into Europe must clearly be placed at
a much later date. It is remarkable enough that the Greeks,
whose country abounds in wild hawks, should have known
nothing of their use in the service of man. Homer, indeed,
speaks of the mountain falcon as &ldquo;the most nimble of birds,&rdquo;

&#7969;&#8017;&#964;&#949; &#954;&#7985;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#962; &#8001;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#966;&#953;&#957;,
&#7953;&#955;&#945;&#966;&#961;&#8001;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#964;&#949;&#951;&#957;&#8033;&#957; <i>Il.</i> xxii. 139); but Sophocles,
in alluding to the triumphs of man in taming and using wild
creatures, omits all mention of the training of hawks, which is
certainly more worthy of notice than mere bird-catching or
the breaking-in of oxen (Soph. <i>Antig.</i> 343). Even the later
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span>
Roman authors refer to the use of trained hawks as an unfamiliar
practice, in vogue only amongst some of the barbarian
tribes.</p>

<p>Until at least some centuries after the Christian era, China
and other countries in the Far East seem to have been the
chief if not the only homes of falconry. But the Lombards,
when they settled in North Italy, in the latter half of the sixth
century, were acquainted with the art; and before the end of
the ninth century it was familiar to the Saxons in England
and throughout the West of Europe. Henry the Fowler, who
became Emperor in 919, seems to have been so nicknamed on
account of his devotion to this form of sport, which was already
a favourite with princes and magnates. The Saxon King
Ethelbert wrote to the Archbishop of Mayence for hawks able
to take cranes. King Harold habitually carried a trained
hawk on his fist; and from the time of the Norman Conquest
hawking was a sport as highly honoured in the civilised world
as hunting. The greatest impulse that was ever given to the
sport in Western Europe was derived from the returning
Crusaders, many of whom, in the course of their travels to the
East, had become acquainted with the Oriental falconers and
the Asiatic modes of training and flying hawks. Conspicuous
amongst such Crusaders was the Emperor Frederick II., who
brought back with him some Asiatic hawks and their trainers,
and who not only was himself an enthusiastic and accomplished
falconer, but even declared that falconry was the noblest of all
arts. From that time&mdash;early in the thirteenth century&mdash;for
more than four hundred years falconry flourished in Europe, as
well as in the East, as a fashionable sport amongst almost all
classes. As in the case of hunting and fishing, its attractions
as a sport were supplemented by the very material merits it
possessed as a means of procuring food. While the prince and
the baron valued their falcon-gentle for its high pitch and lordly
stoop, the yeoman and the burgher set almost equal store on the
less aristocratic goshawk and the plebeian sparrow-hawk as
purveyors of wholesome delicacies for the table. Even the serf
or villein was not forgotten in the field, and was expected, or at
least allowed, to train and carry on his fist the humble but
well-bred and graceful kestrel.</p>

<p>During this long period the example of Henry the Fowler
was followed freely by many of the most celebrated and powerful
rulers in European countries. Hardly a prominent personage
amongst the great conquerors and lawgivers in mediæval times
was unacquainted with the art. Most of them were as enthusiastic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span>
in their devotion to it as they were to the more serious
objects of their ambition. It would be wearisome to recount the
long list of royal falconers; and it will suffice to merely mention
a few of the most notable examples. Thus Edward <span class="smcap">III.</span> was
accompanied on his warlike expedition with a whole train of
falconers. His father had been indulged in his imprisonment
with liberty to go hawking. Shakespeare has familiarised his
readers with the hawking parties of Henry <span class="smcap">VI.</span> and his Queen
(<i>2 Hen. <span class="smcap">VI.</span></i> ii. I); and few people have failed to read the story
of the broken leaping-pole which precipitated Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> into
a ditch as he was following a hawk. Louis <span class="smcap">XI.</span> and a host of
French kings, including Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>, were ardent falconers, as
were many of the kings of Castile and Arragon, Sardinia, and
Hungary. Henry of Navarre was excelled by few men in his
passion for this sport. James <span class="smcap">IV.</span> of Scotland gave a jewelled
hood to one of the Flemings, because the latter had won a
match in which his hawk flew against the King&rsquo;s. And James <span class="smcap">I.</span>
of England enjoyed nothing more keenly than a day&rsquo;s hawking,
declaring that if a man had only patience and good-temper
enough to contend with the disappointments inseparable from
it, the sport would be preferable to hunting. Catherine <span class="smcap">II.</span> of
Russia was as great at falconry as at most other things, and
specially delighted in the flight with merlins. Ecclesiastics,
both great and small, were not a whit behind the laity in their
devotion to the sport of the air. It was thought no scorn for a
holy-water clerk to carry a &ldquo;musket&rdquo; or male sparrow-hawk.
Not only did Cardinal Beaufort fly his falcons with those of the
great Duke of Gloucester, but no less a potentate than Pope
Leo <span class="smcap">X.</span> was constantly in the field at Ravenna, and even incurs
the blame of the great D&rsquo;Arcussia for being in the habit of
too soundly rating his comrades during a flight. The hawking
establishments of all the earlier Bourbons were kept up in more
than royal style, and were supplied annually with rare falcons
from many parts of the world.</p>

<p>It was the invention of shot-guns that struck the first and
most deadly blow at the popularity of hawking. It was soon
discovered that wild-fowl, rabbits, and most kinds of game
could be captured much more easily and cheaply by the aid of
&ldquo;vile saltpetre&rdquo; than by the laborious and costly processes
involved in the reclaiming and moulting and conditioning of
hawks. Economy, as well as novelty, pleaded in favour of the
new sport of shooting. At the same time, the common use of
fowling-pieces added a fresh and formidable danger for the
owners of hawks, already exposed to a thousand unfair risks of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span>
losing their favourites. In the unsettled state to which Europe
was reduced by the innumerable wars consequent on the
Reformation, it was impossible for falconers to identify or
punish those who recklessly or deliberately slaughtered a
neighbour&rsquo;s lost hawks; and although the offenders were still
liable to serve penalties, they could snap their fingers at the
protective laws. Finally, the more rapid subdivision of the
land, and its enclosure with fences for agricultural purposes,
spoilt, for the falconer&rsquo;s purposes, large tracts of country which
had formerly been the most suitable, and was especially hurtful
to the flying of the long-winged hawks, for which an expanse
of open ground is indispensable. On the Continent these various
causes operated surely but slowly to displace falconry in the
public estimation. But in England a special circumstance
almost ruined it at one blow. The outbreak of the Great Civil
War interrupted rudely all peaceful sports, and its disasters
destroyed a vast number of those who were the best patrons of
hawking. From the blow then struck English falconry never
rallied in any general sense. Certainly it did revive, or rather
survive, to a certain extent. It would be wrong to suppose that
the sport has ever been extinct in the British Isles, as so many
writers are fond of reiterating. But its devotees have kept it up
without any of the pomp and show which once distinguished it,
carrying on in comparative privacy, and in the retirement of
rather remote spots, an amusement in which the difficulties
always besetting the sport were aggravated by a thousand new
dangers and annoyances.</p>

<p>The annals of falconry, since it was deposed from its fashionable
place&mdash;in England by the Great Rebellion, and afterwards
in France by the Revolution&mdash;are obscure, and for the most
part buried in oblivion. Here and there the name of a notable
falconer, professional or amateur, emerges from the mist, showing
us that the sport was still carried on with vigour by a few. In
the middle of the eighteenth century Lord Orford flew kites in
the eastern counties, and this sport, as well as rook-hawking
and heron-hawking, was successively carried on by the Falconers'
Society, the Falconers&rsquo; Club, and the High Ash Club, which
latter existed from about 1792 to later than 1830, and included
amongst its members Lord Berners, Colonel Thornton, and
other sporting celebrities. In Scotland falconry has always
been kept up. The life of John Anderson covers the whole of
the last half of the eighteenth century, as well as more than a
quarter of the nineteenth. This accomplished trainer of hawks
was for the first twenty years or so of the present century in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span>
charge of the Renfrewshire establishment kept by Fleming of
Barochan, and flown chiefly at partridges and woodcocks.
During the early years of the same century, until 1814, Colonel
Thornton did a great deal of hawking on his own account, at
first in Yorkshire, and afterwards at Spy Park, in Wiltshire.
From 1823 to 1833 Mr. John Sinclair flew woodcocks with
success in Ireland. In 1840 Lord O&rsquo;Neill and Colonel Bonham
took a moor in Ross-shire for hawking; and in the following
year the Loo Club was started for heron-hawking in Holland,
under the auspices of Mr. E. Clough Newcome. This influential
club continued to flourish till 1853. Its place was taken, not
many years after, by the Old Hawking Club, which, although it
has never undertaken the flight at herons, continues to carry on
an annual campaign against rooks and game with great credit
and success. In France a hawking club was started in 1865,
under the title of the Champagne Club, but was not long-lived;
and several minor attempts at organising new clubs have been
made in England during the last thirty years. There are at the
present moment at least thirty private establishments in England
alone where trained hawks are kept and flown, besides several
in Scotland and Ireland. The names of several of the leading
amateurs now living will be mentioned in this and following
chapters.</p>

<p>Of professional falconers, the supply has sadly dwindled
away since the time when the office of Grand Falconer was
something more than the hereditary title of the Dukes of
St. Albans. It was not, however, until quite recent years
that the supply became quite unequal to the demand. At
the death of John Anderson in 1832 there were able successors
to keep alive the best traditions of the old Scotch
school. Foremost among them was Peter Ballantine, of
whom, as well as of Mr. Newcome, excellent likenesses are
published in Mr. Harting&rsquo;s fine work, <i>Bibliotheca Accipitraria</i>.
This accomplished trainer survived until 1884. Nearly contemporary
with him were the brothers Barr, whose names
are frequently mentioned in these pages. While these and
others upheld the sport in Scotland, England, Ireland, and
France&mdash;for John Barr acted as the falconer of the Champagne
Club&mdash;John Pells in Norfolk, once falconer to the Duke of
Leeds, attained to great efficiency and repute; and the names
of Bots and Möllen became celebrated in Holland as the
successful hawk-catchers and servants of the Loo Club. Later
still, John Frost acted for eighteen years as the energetic and
skilful falconer of the Old Hawking Club. He was succeeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
by George Oxer, who, with the Retfords (James and William)
and the sons of John Frost, is still living. There are at the
present moment several very young falconers who bid fair to
attain distinction, though their training is derived mostly from
lessons imparted to them by the amateurs who have brought
them out. It is to be hoped that, now the facilities for travelling
are so immensely increased, some modern imitator of
Frederick <span class="smcap">II.</span> will bring back from India a native falconer or
two, whose experience in the tropics would be invaluable, and
thus infuse new life into the professional world of Europe.</p>

<p>Of amateurs there has been for some years past no lack in
England; and want of space alone prevents the enumeration of
the distinguished falconers who still keep up in the British
islands and dependencies the best traditions of their art.
Amongst these it would be unfair to pass over the most conspicuous
names, such as those of the late Lord Lilford and
Captain Salvin and Mr. William Brodrick, the first named as
justly famous for his acquaintance with hawks as for his knowledge
of ornithology. Captain Salvin first familiarised the
modern English people with the training of cormorants, and
with the flight with peregrines at rooks. Mr. Brodrick illustrated
with his own admirable coloured figures the handsome and
useful book on falconry which he published jointly with
Captain Salvin. Another joint-author with the latter was the
Rev. Gage Earle Freeman, who for many years most successfully
flew, in a far from perfect country, peregrines at grouse,
merlins at larks, goshawks and sparrow-hawks at various quarry.
The small book which owes its authorship to these two masters
of the art has long been out of print. It is impossible to praise
it too highly as a handbook for beginners. Of living falconers,
no one can be compared in experience and general knowledge
with Major Hawkins Fisher, of the Castle, Stroud, whose game-hawks
have for more than fourteen years annually killed good
bags of grouse at Riddlehamhope, in Northumberland, and
whose favourite peregrines, such as &ldquo;Lady Jane,&rdquo; "Lundy," and
&ldquo;Band of Hope,&rdquo; have been a terror to partridges in Wilts and
Gloucestershire. Mr. St. Quintin, of Scampston Hall, Yorkshire,
probably the most successful game-hawker of whom we have
any record, has recently brought to a high degree of perfection
the flight with peregrines at gulls. The fine sport shown at
rooks every year in Wiltshire by the Old Hawking Club, is due
chiefly to the ability and energy of their secretary, the Hon.
Gerald Lascelles. In flights with short-winged hawk of both
descriptions, Mr. John Riley, of Putley Court, Herefordshire, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
<i>facile princeps</i>. The late Rev. W. Willemot did some good work
with falcons at gulls before this branch of the sport was taken
up by Mr. St. Quintin; and the late Mr. T. J. Mann, of Hyde
Hall, Sawbridgeworth, was successful with rooks and partridges
in Cambridgeshire. Probably the most splendid establishment of
hawks in England during the last forty years was that of the
late Maharajah Dhuleep Singh at Elvedon. Falconry in India
has been extensively practised by many English officers
quartered in that part of the world, and notably by General
Griffiths, and more lately by Captain S. Biddulph, who has
probably killed a greater variety of wild quarry than any
European now living, and whose portraits of trained hawks are
above all praise. Colonel Delmé Radcliffe, Colonel Brooksbank,
Colonel Watson, Captain Crabbe, the late Sir Henry
Boynton, Mr. A. W. Reed, Major Anne, and Mr. Arthur Newall,
are all enthusiastic and successful falconers. Colonel Ayshford
Sanford, Major C. W. Thompson, of the 7th Dragoon Guards,
and the writer of these pages, have had considerable success
with merlins.</p>

<p>In France, the names of MM. Barachin, Sourbets, Arbel, and
Belvallette for the short-winged hawks, and MM. Pichot and
Paul Gervais for other kinds, require honourable notice; and in
Russia that of the late M. Constantine Haller will always be
remembered. It is not many years since the latter originated
and carried into effect the scheme of an International Hawking
Congress, to be held near St. Petersburg. This was attended by
many Asiatic falconers, and one from England. But the impossibility
of finding suitable wild quarry in accessible places
sadly interfered with the success of the meeting; and the result
was not proportionate to the great trouble of organising it.</p>

<p>It will naturally be supposed that a sport so fashionable, so
prevalent, and so difficult as falconry, has been discussed at
length in many writings and in many languages. For the very
extensive literature treating of its art and practice in different
parts of the world, the reader is referred to Mr. Harting&rsquo;s <i>Bibliotheca
Accipitraria</i>, already mentioned, in which a full account is
given of no less than three hundred and seventy-eight works on
the subject. Of these, eighty-two are in English, and eighty-four
in French. The German publications number forty-six, the
Italian thirty-eight, the Japanese fourteen, and there are several
in Spanish, Russian, Latin, Greek, and Chinese.</p>

<p>The most notable works, besides those already mentioned,
are the Latin treatise written by the Emperor Frederick <span class="smcap">II.</span>; <i>The
Boke of St. Albans</i>, by Dame Juliana Berners, 1486; the volumes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
published by Turbervile in 1575, by Latham in 1615, and by
Bert on the short-winged hawks in 1635. Still more interesting
are the books written in French by Charles d&rsquo;Arcussia, which
date from 1598 to 1627. The nineteenth century has produced
several important works, including the small treatise by Sir
John Sebright, 1826, and the splendid illustrated volume by
Schlegel and Wulverhorst, 1853. The Badminton Library
contains half a volume on Falconry from the very able pen of
Mr. Gerald Lascelles; and the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> has an
article on the subject by Colonel Delmé Radcliffe.</p>

<p>To look for any real revival of falconry in Europe would be
altogether quixotic. Lucky indeed may the falconer of the future
consider himself if the art even survives. Already the goshawk,
the ger, and the golden eagle are almost extinct in England;
sparrow-hawks have become so rare that constant advertisements
offering to buy one remain without response; the harmless
hobby and innocuous merlin are ferociously persecuted, and
have been exterminated in most of their favourite haunts. A
lost hawk has become almost a synonym for a murdered hawk.
Owners are beset with enemies on every hand, besides being
plagued and pestered by ignorant and impertinent intruders, if
ever they venture with their hawks into a public place. The
country becomes more and more unsuitable for hawking purposes.
Upon many of the most open spaces bricks and mortar
intrude; upon other parts the vexatious small plantations designed
as shelters for game. Even when a suitable grouse-moor
or partridge-ground is found in want of a tenant, obstacles may
be raised. A baseless but deep-rooted prejudice deters many
lessors from allowing trained hawks to be flown over their land,
on the absurd plea that it will spoil it for subsequent tenants.
In short, the impediments with which the modern falconer has
to contend are too many and too great for any but a few very
determined sportsmen. These, when they have once mastered
the initial difficulties, usually persist in preferring the sport to
any other. &ldquo;Once a falconer, always a falconer,&rdquo; is a maxim of
universal truth. And the fraternal spirit which animates most
English falconers&mdash;and, for that matter, most falconers throughout
the world&mdash;is not the least agreeable feature presented by
this ancient and honourable field sport.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">The Birds used in Hawking</span></p>


<p>Of the numerous birds of prey which are found in various
parts of the globe, a good many have been employed in
the service of man as agents in the pursuit of other birds and of
four-footed animals, partly for purposes of supplying him with
food, and partly for sport. It is more than probable that others
might be similarly trained and flown, especially some of the
American and Australian hawks, which seem suitable for the purpose,
but which have never yet, as far as we know, been thus
taken in hand. It is not, however, proposed to describe at
length any members of the large family of Raptores, except
such as are known to have been used in hawking; and with
regard to those which have been flown only in remote parts
of the world, considerations of space necessitate a very brief
reference.</p>

<p>It has usually been said that the list of birds used in hawking
includes only two main divisions&mdash;the long-winged hawks,
as falconers call them, known to naturalists under the name of
&ldquo;falcons&rdquo;; and the short-winged hawks, to which the men of
science apply specially the name of hawks. This ornithological
classification of falcons on the one hand and hawks on the
other, is not a very happy one; for in the general public estimation,
as well as in falconers&rsquo; phraseology, every falcon is a
hawk, although every hawk may not be properly called a falcon.
The one term is of classic, and the other of Teutonic origin; and
it was too late, when books about birds first began to be written
scientifically, to attempt to establish a hard-and-fast difference
between words which had already passed current for centuries as
meaning pretty much the same thing. Moreover, hawking, which,
if the naturalists&rsquo; view of the matter were accepted, ought to
be concerned, like the French <i>autourserie</i>, with the short-winged
hawks only, has long been considered in England a mere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span>
synonym for falconry, which also, if interpreted strictly according
to the ornithological theory, ought to be regarded as dealing
with the long-winged species.</p>

<p>The two-fold division, however, no matter whether it is into
falcons and hawks, or into short-winged and long-winged hawks,
seems to be insufficient and unsatisfactory. For eagles, which
have been, and still are, extensively used in a sport for which the
only English names are hawking and falconry, remain unincluded
in the two usually accepted classes. No eagle can properly
be called either a hawk or a falcon; and in order to find
a place for them amongst the birds trained and flown at quarry,
it seems necessary to institute a third class. What order of
precedence should be taken by such new class is a matter
of small consequence. In symmetry of shape, in its mode of
flying, its character, and its tastes, the eagle is as inferior to the
true hawk as the latter has always been deemed to be to the
true falcon; and in this work, as in others on falconry, the
first place has been retained for the long-winged hawks, and the
second for the short-winged, leaving a third place for what little
it seems necessary to say about such eagles as we know to have
been flown at game.</p>

<p>The long-winged hawk is known by the following characteristics:&mdash;The
second primary feather in the wing, reckoning from
the outside, is the longest, or at least equal in length to any
other, as in the merlin, which has the second and third feathers
very nearly or quite of the same length. The upper mandible
has on each of its sides, about a third part of the distance
from the point to the cere, a projection somewhat resembling a
very blunt tooth. The eye is dark brown. The wing is long
enough in the outer joint to come down, when closed, considerably
more than half-way between the end of the tail coverts and
the end of the tail itself, and in some cases, as in the hobby, as
far as the tail, or even farther.</p>

<p>In the short-winged hawks the wing is comparatively short
in the outer joint, and, when expanded, presents a rounded
appearance at the end, the fourth primary being the longest,
and the first very short. That emargination, or narrowing in,
of the feather near its end, which is observable in the first two
primaries of the long-winged hawk, is still more pronounced in
the short-winged, and is conspicuous in the third and fourth
primaries also. The tail is long, and large when expanded. The
iris is of some shade of yellow, light or dark. The upper mandible
curves in a smooth line, without any projecting tooth.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 497px;">
<img src="images/fp_011.png" width="497" height="702" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">SHAPE OF WINGS</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span></p>

<p>In the eagles the tail is shorter and stouter. The outer
joint of the wing is shorter than in the falcons, the wing deriving
its power from the feathers near the body rather than from the
outer ones. The beak is longer in shape than that of the other
two sorts, and the legs are proportionately stouter. The size of
the smallest eagle is very much greater than that of the largest
falcon or hawk.</p>

<p>The differences which exist in the shape of the wing between
the three classes will perhaps be best appreciated by a glance
at the accompanying illustration, in which a characteristic wing
of each kind is figured.</p>

<p>The French have convenient terms (see Belvallette, <i>Traité
d&rsquo;Autourserie</i>, Paris, 1887) which express in themselves, with
great perspicuity, though perhaps a little exaggeration, the
different methods of flying employed by the short- and the long-winged
hawks. The latter they describe as <i>ramiers</i>, or rowers,
because their mode of progression through the air resembles
that of an oarsman, or rather sculler, striking with repeated
beats of his sculls; whilst they describe the short-winged hawks
(with eagles and all birds that have rounded wings) as <i>voiliers</i>,
or sailers, maintaining that their impulse is gained by the
pressure of the air against the wing, upon which it acts as upon
a sail. Many people may be inclined to call such a distinction
rather fanciful, and even question its truth; but the mere fact
that the two words have been accepted as correctly denoting
the two separate styles of flying, shows what a marked difference
between them has been generally admitted to exist. It will be
seen that the mode of flying the &ldquo;rowers&rdquo; and the &ldquo;sailers&rdquo; at
quarry is also very distinct.</p>

<p>In accordance with the three-fold classification above suggested,
I now proceed to mention the various birds used in
hawking under the successive headings of&mdash;(1) Long-winged
hawks; (2) Short-winged hawks; and (3) Eagles.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="caption3">I. THE LONG-WINGED HAWKS (Falcons)</span><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> It should be observed that although the term falcon has an established meaning
among ornithologists as a name for the long-winged hawks, it is used by falconers
in quite a different acceptation. In hawking phraseology it is applied, in contradistinction
to the term tiercel, to the female of the larger sorts of long-winged hawks,
and especially to the female peregrine. Thus when a falconer is described as being
possessed of &ldquo;two falcons,&rdquo; or a hare is mentioned as having been taken by a
&ldquo;falcon,&rdquo; the reader is expected to know that the female peregrine is referred to,
and not a male peregrine, or a saker, lanner, or any other kind of hawk.</p></div>

<p>Perhaps the leading characteristic in the flying of this kind
of hawk is that it habitually captures its prey, or, as falconers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span>
term it, &ldquo;quarry,&rdquo; by making a dash or shot at it, technically
called a stoop, from some position where it can command an
advantage in speed and force. In many cases the bird is itself
so conscious of this natural aptitude for stooping in preference
to mere following, that it habitually places itself, when on the
look-out for food, at a considerable height, from which it can
descend with great ease and velocity upon any victim which
may happen to be passing beneath, using the principle of
gravity to increase the force of its downward flight; and in
several departments of the falconer&rsquo;s art the trainer endeavours
to encourage the tendency of his hawk to mount and make the
most of the advantage so gained. The long-winged hawks are
as a rule trained to come to the lure, and not to the fist,
although for the sake of convenience it is sometimes found
advisable to make them to both practices.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Greenland Falcon</span> (<i>Falco candicans</i>)</p>

<p>Female&mdash;Length, about 23 inches; wing, 16.5; tail, 9. Male&mdash;Length,
about 20 inches; wing, 14.5; tail, 8.</p>

<p>The general colour in the adult of both sexes is white, with
more or less faint bars of light brownish grey on the upper
plumage, and spots of the same colour underneath. The young
birds of both sexes are considerably darker than their elders,
with a much larger allowance of darker grey brown on the
plumage both above and below. These dark patches and
markings become fainter and less abundant at each moult,
until in very old birds they almost vanish, leaving the hawk to
appear at a distance merely white. The bars on the back,
shoulders, and wings are often shaped like the two arms of an
anchor; and the spots on the breast are mostly tear-shaped,
especially after the first moult. The legs, feet, cere, and eyelids
are bluish grey in the young birds, but after the first moult
become yellow, strengthening in colour at each moult.</p>

<p>It will be seen by reference to the remarks on comparative
merits of falcons (<a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII">Chap. <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span></a>), that in proportions this species
excels all the other gers. It is also the most majestic in its
appearance and attitudes, and the most noble in the expression
of its eyes and, if the term may be permitted, of its countenance.
It was not so much used in the Middle Ages as the
other gers, by reason of the difficulty of obtaining it, but
was probably the most highly valued of all. The late Lord
Lilford, who in quite modern times had a good deal of experience
with this species, opined that it was an excellent flier and

stooper, but a poor &ldquo;footer,&rdquo; that it was the reverse of hardy,
and difficult to keep in condition. When observed in the wild
state in Scotland it was found to kill a great many rooks, and
to be dreaded by the wild-fowl, but not to be partial to game,
though it was seen to make an ineffectual stoop at a blackcock.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Iceland Falcon</span> (<i>Falco islandus</i>)</p>

<p>Female&mdash;Length, about 24 inches; wing, about 17; tail,
9&#188;. Male&mdash;Length, about 21 inches; wing, 15; tail, 8&#188;.</p>

<p>In young birds the upper parts are dark greyish brown or
brownish grey, each feather barred and tipped with a much
lighter grey. The under plumage is dusky white, splashed
more or less profusely, especially on the breast and flanks, with
streaky spots and splashes of greyish brown. At the first
moult the brown tinge begins to disappear, and the spots on
the breast and flanks become more heart-shaped than longitudinal,
and less profuse. In subsequent moults the spots
become smaller and smaller, and the whole plumage fades to a
lighter grey, the bars on the upper plumage often softening
gradually to a greyish white. The sides of the head and lower
nape are white, with brownish lead-coloured shaft marks in the
immature plumage, fading and diminishing as the hawk moults.
The moustachial streak is wanting in this variety.</p>

<p>This species of ger was very highly esteemed in antiquity;
and individual falcons were occasionally presented by the kings
of Denmark to foreign potentates as a high compliment. In
modern times it has been found delicate, and difficult to keep in
health. Mr. Newcome had some which flew well at herons, but
did not find them so generally effective as peregrines. The late
Maharajah Dhuleep Singh flew them with success at hares. Lord
Lilford, however, was unable to get them to fly rabbits or hares,
and found them liable to a troublesome affection of the feet.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Norway Falcon</span> (<i>Falco gyrfalco</i>)</p>

<p>Female&mdash;Length, about 22 inches; wing, 16; tail, 9. Male&mdash;Length,
19&#189; inches; wing, 14; tail, 8&#188;.</p>

<p>In the young the general colour of the upper plumage is a
lead-coloured brown, each feather tipped and margined with a
somewhat lighter brown or buff. The flight feathers are also
similarly margined. The lower back is sometimes tinged with
grey. The tail is tipped with white, and barred rather closely
with a speckly buff. The breast is profusely streaked with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span>
longitudinal blotches on a white ground, as in the peregrine;
but these markings are of a rather duller brown. At the moult
the markings on the under plumage diminish greatly in size and
number, especially on and near the chin, and become more or
less tear-shaped&mdash;this tendency to decrease continuing in subsequent
moults. In the upper plumage the brown is replaced by
slatey grey, barred with a lighter blue-grey, which in patches,
especially upon parts of the feathers which are habitually
hidden, are nearly white. The tail becomes slatey brown, with
narrow bars of brownish grey. This species has a broad well-marked
moustachial streak, which is dark brown in the immature
and dark grey in the adult. The cere and eyelids are
blue-grey, and the legs and feet bluish lead colour; but all
become yellow in the adult.</p>

<p>This species is found not only in Norway, but also along the
whole expanse of Northern Europe and Asia. It is the nearest
in colouring and disposition to the peregrine, and the most
remote from the Greenlander. Lord Lilford considered that it
was not so fast as the Greenlander, and its shape is certainly
not so indicative either of speed or of strength. John Barr was
sent over by Captain Dugmore some few years ago to Norway,
and brought back sixteen of these hawks. They flew beautifully
to the lure, turning more quickly than a peregrine, and stooping
with greater dash, but were of little use in the field, and mostly
fell speedy victims to the croaks or other maladies.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Labrador Falcon</span> (<i>Falco labradorus</i>)</p>

<p>This is another species of the ger family, found, as its name
imports, in Labrador. It is of a much darker coloration than
even the Norway falcon, but not very different in measurements.
It has not, as far as I can learn, been trained for sporting purposes,
though no doubt it very well might be.<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_2" id="Footnote_1_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Although the name gyrfalco&mdash;the gyrating or circling falcon&mdash;is now appropriated
by most ornithologists to the Norway birds, all the foregoing were included
by the old falconers under the name ger, gyr, or jer. They are all so styled, and
very properly, by modern usage. They are indeed little, if anything, more than
climatic varieties of the same bird, and although it has not been ascertained beyond a
doubt that they interbreed, this is highly probable. The lightest variety of each one
species is almost, if not quite, undistinguishable from the darkest of the next; and
the character of all is similar enough to admit of their being trained and treated in
the same way. From the falconer&rsquo;s point of view, there will certainly be less
difference between one Iceland falcon and one of either of the two nearest allied
species than there may be between two individual specimens of <i>F. islandus</i>. They
will all therefore be dealt with in the remaining chapters under the same general
name of gers, unless when any special consideration involves a more specific
indication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span></p></div>

<p>The difference of size between the two sexes in the case of
these splendid birds is, as it will be seen, considerable. But
both are so superior in speed and strength to any creatures at
which they are at all likely to be flown in England, that the list
of quarry suitable for the gerfalcon will, with a very few exceptions,
serve for the ger tiercel also. This list includes gulls
of all kinds, herons, rooks and crows, wood-pigeon, black-game,
grouse, partridges, hares and rabbits, wild-duck of all descriptions,
Norfolk plover, and all the sea-fowls found on the coasts
of Great Britain and Ireland, except swans, and perhaps wild
geese. The gerfalcon will also take these latter, as well as kites
and cranes, peacocks, ptarmigan, and bustards, at which the
best of them may be flown in countries where such birds are to
be found in sufficiently open places. It is recorded of Henry,
king of Navarre, that he had a gerfalcon which Scaliger declares
to have struck down in his sight a buzzard, two wild geese,
divers kites, a crane, and a swan (Sir Thomas Browne, cited by
Harting, <i>Bibliotheca Accipitraria</i>, xxvii.). The flight of the ger
is marked by an appearance of power suitable to its size and
shape, and combines in an extraordinary degree swiftness and
the power of turning readily. When taught to wait on, it does
so in majestic style, often at a stupendous height; and its stoop
from that direction is so &ldquo;hard,&rdquo; as the old falconers termed it,
or in other words so swift and impetuous, that the quarry is less
often clutched and held than struck down with a blow as the
hawk passes, and is often found either killed or altogether disabled
by the violence of the shock. So great, indeed, is the
vehemence with which the ger flies and stoops, that the old
masters warned their pupils not to work them long on any
occasion, for fear of tiring them, and thus lowering their &ldquo;pitch,&rdquo;
or impairing their powers of mounting.</p>

<p>Gers have not had a very fair trial in the hands of modern
falconers. They have seldom come into their possession under
favourable conditions. Greenlanders, especially, have for the
most part been brought to European shores by ships, upon
which they were caught at sea by men quite unacquainted with
the proper mode of treating a wild-caught hawk. Almost
always their plumage has suffered badly; and they themselves,
having been kept alive on unsuitable or scanty food, have been
reduced so low as to permanently lose some of their natural
strength and vitality. The same thing may be said of several
Icelanders and Norwegians which have reached the hands of
the falconer in pitiable plight. Gers are very seldom taken
on the passage in Holland, although one tiercel, captured by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
Adrian Möllen in 1878, was acquired and trained by the Old
Hawking Club, and proved a fine performer at rooks. Reference
has already been made to the gers brought by John Barr from
Norway. Mr. Newcome, who in the treatment of peregrines
was excelled by no falconer of modern times, was dissatisfied
with the gers which he trained, and found them difficult to keep
in condition.</p>

<p>D&rsquo;Arcussia, who, of course, had many gers under his charge,
declares that their principal excellence was in mounting, whereas
in the downward stoop the peregrine might be awarded the palm.
This opinion, however, can hardly be reconciled with the more
forcible and striking words which he uses in another passage,
where he tells us that having trained some gers for partridges
he took them out before a company of experts, who, after seeing
these hawks fly, were &ldquo;disgusted with all other hawks.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Peregrine</span> (<i>Falco peregrinus</i>)</p>

<p>Female&mdash;Length, about 18 inches; wing, 14; tail, 7; tarsus,
2&#188;. Male&mdash;Length, about 16 inches; wing, 12; tail, 6; tarsus, 2.</p>

<p>In young birds of both sexes the upper plumage is a more
or less dark brown, inclining in some individuals to chocolate
colour, and in others to black, each feather of the back, wing,
and tail coverts tipped with a lighter and more rufous brown.
The chin, neck, breast, thighs, and whole under plumage is
more or less dull creamy white, streaked plentifully with longitudinal
blotches of dark brown, which are thin and small at
the neck, but become broader and bigger as they approach
the lower part of the breast, dying away again towards the
vent. The tail is greyish brown on the upper surface, tipped
with more or less rufous white, and barred with five or six
rather irregular and rather faint bands of darker brown. The
under part of the tail is very faint brownish grey, barred with a
somewhat darker hue of the same colour. The sides of the
head and neck are dull creamy white, streaked with very small
dashes and markings of dark brown. On the under side of
the eyebrow, passing round the eyelids, is a patch or streak of
very dark brown, and a broad streak of the same colour or of
black reaches like a moustache from near the back of the upper
mandible backwards for an inch.</p>

<p>The legs, feet, cere, and eyelids vary from light blue-grey to
greenish yellow and pale ochre; beak, light bluish grey, darkening
to black at the tip; claws&mdash;called always by falconers
&ldquo;talons&rdquo;&mdash;black, as in other hawks of all kinds. In the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span>
moult the brown of the whole upper plumage is replaced by a
slatey blue, each feather from the shoulders to the end of the
tail barred transversely and tipped more or less distinctly with
a lighter shade of blue-grey. The slate colour on the crown
and side of the head, including the moustache, is of a dark hue.
The under plumage, instead of being streaked longitudinally
with brown, becomes at the first moult spotted and splashed
with markings of dark grey, which are partly transverse and
partly shaped like an arrow-head or tear-drop, especially on
the throat and gorge. At each successive moult these spots
and markings become more transverse and bar-like, and also
narrower and more sparse on the parts nearest the chin, until
in very old birds they disappear on the chin and throat, leaving
a blank surface of pure creamy white. Even before the first
moult the feet and legs begin to assume a yellow colour; and
by the time the first moult is over, they and the cere and
eyelids have changed to a more or less decided yellow, which
as the bird grows old develops into a rich gold.</p>

<p>Both sexes undergo the same changes in plumage, but it
should be said that these hawks at all ages vary considerably in
size and shape, and still more in their colouring. It is not
unusual to see an eyess which has the head and parts of the
upper plumage nearly black, while the brown of others at the
same age is as light as cocoa, with buff edgings. Some detailed
remarks as to the size and shape of peregrines and other hawks
will be found in <a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII">Chapter <span class="smcap">XVIII</span>.</a>
, where it will be seen that some
are of much more prepossessing appearance than others.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, the peregrine may be regarded as the
most perfect type of combined strength, speed, and destructive
power in birds. The proportions are such as could not be
altered with any advantage, and adapt the hawk to a greater
variety of flight than any other. This reason, and the fact
that it is to be found in almost all parts of the habitable world,
have always made it a favourite with falconers; and at the
present day it is more highly esteemed in Europe than any
other, even including the nobler gers.</p>

<p>The female&mdash;to which sex alone falconers allow the application
of the name of falcon&mdash;may be flown with success in this
country at herons, gulls of all kinds, ducks of all kinds, crows,
rooks, grouse, black-game, partridge, pheasant, woodcock, landrail,
Norfolk plover, curlew, and other sea birds of about
the same size, magpies, wood-pigeons, and doves. She may
also generally, if desired, be taught to fly at hares, and no
doubt at rabbits. Occasionally she may take plovers and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
snipe, jackdaws, kestrels, and smaller birds. In India her list
includes wild geese, cranes, bitterns, ibis, and bustard.</p>

<p>The male peregrine&mdash;always called a tiercel (tassel, or
tiercelet), because he is about a third smaller in size than his
sister&mdash;may be flown at gulls, teal, widgeon, partridges, woodcock,
landrail, starling, and the smaller sea birds, magpies, and
doves; and when exceptionally strong and courageous, will
succeed to a greater or less extent with rooks, crows, jackdaws,
grouse, wood-pigeons, and kestrels. In India and Eastern
countries the francolin and the florican, and several sorts of
duck and plovers, may be added to the list.</p>

<p>The peregrine at different ages was described in old times
by a great variety of names, some of which are now little used,
or even understood. Thus, in the eyrie or nest, from the time
when she was &ldquo;disclosed,&rdquo; or hatched, for a fortnight or three
weeks she was called an eyess (or nyas, from the French <i>niais</i>).
When able to move about on her legs she became a ramage
hawk; and when she could jump or flit from branch to branch,
a brancher. After leaving the nest and becoming fledged, as
the term is for other birds, she was described as a soar-hawk
or sore-hawk (French, <i>sor</i>, from the Latin <i>saurus</i>, reddish
brown); and when her feathers were all fully grown down she
was said to be summed, whereas before this time she remained
unsummed. The period during which she could properly be
called a soar-hawk lasted, according to some eminent writers,
from June 15 to September 15, when the migrating time begins,
and she came to be more properly spoken of as a passage-hawk
(or true <i>pélérin</i>). This designation carried her down to
the end of the year, when she assumed, according to the French
falconers, the title of <i>antennaire</i>; that is to say, a hawk whose
feathers, or whose whole self, belong to last year (<i>antan</i>). Many
of the English falconers, however, gave her no new title until
at or near the arrival of Lent, when they called her a Lantiner,
Lentener, or Lent-hawk, for as long as Lent lasted, that is to
say, till near moulting-time. The great similarity of the two
names Lantiner and Antennaire, given as they were to the
same hawk at the same time of her life in the two countries,
suggests a strong doubt whether the former was not a mere
corruption of the latter. During the whole of this time the
unmoulted peregrine was known, from the colour of her plumage,
as a red hawk; and this term is still constantly employed.
Many writers also called her during the same period merely
a soar-hawk, neglecting the finer distinctions. It seems also
that for a hawk which had been taken in August or thereabouts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span>
and kept in captivity, it was quite correct to continue
the name soar until her first moult was over. Passage-hawks
and lantiners were those only which had been caught in late
autumn or late winter; and these words could never be used
for such as had been caught before. As for the terms &ldquo;gentle&rdquo;
and &ldquo;slight,&rdquo; they seem most properly to belong to peregrines
which had been caught after they left the nest, but before they
began to migrate.</p>

<p>In spring or early summer the young peregrine naturally begins
to moult; and as soon as this tedious operation is concluded
she becomes, if wild, a &ldquo;haggard,&rdquo; and if tame, an &ldquo;intermewed&rdquo;
hawk. In any case she is described as &ldquo;blue,&rdquo; and not &ldquo;red.&rdquo;
There is some doubt as to the meaning of the term haggard,
many authorities, including the lexicographers, deriving it from
the Saxon <i>hag</i>, meaning hedge. A more rational explanation
seems to be that which traces it to the Hebrew word <i>agar</i>
or <i>hagar</i>, meaning wild, as it is used in the Old Testament.
Wildness, indeed, is always regarded by Shakespeare and other
writers as the characteristic of the adult wild hawk, and not
any liking for hedges, to which no peregrine is very partial.</p>

<p>The language, or jargon, of falconry appropriated to the
falcon, and, by analogy, to other hawks, especially of the long-winged
species, special terms for various parts of her body and
various movements and conditions; much in the same way as
several of the Oriental languages describe the actions of royalty
by special names. Thus her wings are sails: the long feathers
of them are flight feathers; and of these the outer are principals;
and next to them are the flags. Her tail is her train;
and the two central feathers of it are deck feathers. Her lower
leg is an arm, and her foot a hand, with petty singles instead of
toes, and talons instead of vulgar claws. Her nostrils are
nares; her breast feathers are mails; her lower intestine is her
pannel; and her crop her gorge.</p>

<p>A host of the commonest actions are dignified by more or less
quaint appellations. When a hawk sleeps she &ldquo;jowks&rdquo;; when
she sips water she &ldquo;bowses.&rdquo; When she seizes her quarry in
the air she &ldquo;binds&rdquo; to it; and when her companion in the
flight comes up and also takes hold, she or he is said to &ldquo;join.&rdquo;
When she strips the feathers of the &ldquo;pelt,&rdquo; or dead body, of the
quarry, she &ldquo;deplumes&rdquo;; and as she passes the food from her
crop downwards she &ldquo;puts over.&rdquo; To &ldquo;endue&rdquo; is to digest;
to &ldquo;feak&rdquo; is to wipe her beak after eating; to &ldquo;rouse&rdquo; is to
shake herself; to &ldquo;mantle&rdquo; is to stretch out the leg in a sideways
and backward direction, and afterwards stretch the wing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span>
over it; to &ldquo;mute&rdquo; is to evacuate; and to &ldquo;cast&rdquo; is to throw
up the refuse feathers, bones, and other indigestible matter
which remains in her crop after a meal has been digested.
When a hawk is pushed or forcibly held down by the hands
she is said to be &ldquo;cast&rdquo; (French, <i>abattue</i>); and when she is
bound up in a wrapping, so as not to be able to move, she is
&ldquo;mailed.&rdquo; When a silk thread is passed by means of a needle
through the upper eyelids and made fast under the chin she is
said to be &ldquo;seeled,&rdquo; and the process of undoing these fastenings
is called &ldquo;unseeling.&rdquo; When she stretches her wings upwards
over her head she &ldquo;warbles.&rdquo; When quarry is put up for her,
she is &ldquo;served&rdquo; with it. When she drives a quarry to take
refuge in covert she is said to &ldquo;put in&rdquo;; and when she rises in
the air over the place where the quarry has gone into hiding
she &ldquo;makes her point.&rdquo; If instead of doing this she goes and
takes perch on a tree or other place of vantage, she &ldquo;blocks.&rdquo;
When her digestive organs are brought into good condition she
is said to be &ldquo;enseamed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most of these words can be used indifferently for both long-winged
and short-winged hawks; but others are inappropriate
for the latter. Thus it is wrong to call the claws of a short-winged
hawk talons; and a goshawk or sparrow-hawk does not
&ldquo;mute,&rdquo; but &ldquo;slice.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Black Shaheen</span> (<i>Falco peregrinator</i>, or <i>Falco atriceps</i>)</p>

<p>This hawk is decidedly smaller than the true peregrine, the
female hardly exceeding a big tiercel in length or weight. It
is distinguished by the darker colour of its head, and especially
of the sides and moustachial streak, which may be called black.
The under parts of the body have a more or less pronounced
rufous tinge; and the ends of the wings, when closed, approach
more nearly to the end of the tail.</p>

<p>The black shaheen is docile, and more easily reclaimed than
the peregrine; and is a great favourite with some of the Indian
falconers, although the many distinguished Europeans who
have flown hawks in that country express themselves less
satisfied, and rather doubt the courage of peregrinator in the
field. The quarry is the same as that of the peregrine, but it
is only the strongest individuals which can be expected to
cope with such heavy birds as the latter can tackle. Of the
rapidity of its flight there can be no doubt; but Colonel Delmé
Radcliffe says that it is inferior to the peregrine in &ldquo;ringing&rdquo;
flights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span></p>

<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Red-naped Shaheen</span> (<i>Falco babylonicus</i>)</p>

<p>Female&mdash;Length, about 17&#188; inches; wing, 13; tail, 7&#188;.
Male&mdash;Length, 15&#189; inches; wing, about 11&#190;; tail, 6&#188;.</p>

<p>This is another very near relation of the peregrine, also a
favourite with the Indian falconers, both native and European.
It is slightly smaller than the black shaheen, from which, as
well as from <i>F. peregrinus</i>, it is readily distinguished by the
reddish chestnut colour of the back of the head. The foot is
smaller proportionately than that of the peregrine, and shaped
rather more like that of the desert falcons. It is easily caught
and reclaimed, and is said to develop a sort of affection for its
trainer. When trained it is a most useful servant, and will fly
with readiness and success at almost any of the innumerable
Indian birds which are anywhere nearly of its own size. It
excels particularly in the flight at wild ducks; and a specimen
which was brought to England not many years ago proved
a first-rate game-hawk. Latham asserts that it can be
flown successfully at wild geese, but should be followed
closely by well-mounted men, who should dismount quickly
and secure the quarry, which may otherwise severely damage
the hawk with its long and strong wings. He appears to
have known a tiercel which flew rooks, and seldom missed
as much as one in ten flights. It is a better moulter than
the peregrine, and can sometimes be fully moulted by August.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Barbary Falcon</span> (<i>Falco barbarus</i>)</p>

<p>Female&mdash;Length, about 13&#189; inches; wing, 11&#189;; tail, 5&#189;.
Male&mdash;Length, about 12&#190; inches; wing, 10&#190;; tail, 5.3.</p>

<p>This beautifully-shaped hawk is the smallest of those which
have been commonly called miniature peregrines; and the resemblance
is hardly so marked in either of the last-mentioned
varieties. For the barbary is even more powerfully armed and
feathered than her bigger cousins, having not only the wings
conspicuously longer and more pointed than <i>F. peregrinus</i>,
but also distinctly larger feet and talons, and a larger beak
proportionately to her size. The colouring is the same as that
of the peregrine, except that the young birds are generally
lighter, especially about the head, which has a slightly ruddy
tint; and the feet are more usually yellow than grey-blue. In
adults the thighs are strongly marked with arrow-headed
streaks. This hawk is sometimes called the Tartaret. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
found in the southern portion of the temperate zone, especially
on the African and other shores of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The falcons and strong tiercels will fly well at partridges,
pigeons, and doves. Quails, of course, are easily taken by
them, as they are exceedingly fast on the wing. If a cast of
haggards could be trained for peewit or snipe, and well entered,
they would probably have as good a chance as any hawk which
could be selected for these difficult flights.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Lesser Falcon</span> (<i>Falco minor</i>)</p>

<p>This hawk very much resembles the last, but has longer legs,
and a slight rufous tinge on the plumage. It is found chiefly
in South Africa.</p>

<p class="pmt2">The <span class="smcap">Punic Falcon</span> (<i>F. punicus</i>), the <span class="smcap">Javanese Falcon</span>
(<i>F. melanogenys</i>), and the <span class="smcap">Chilian Falcon</span> (<i>F. cassini</i>), all
more or less resemble the peregrine, but with variations in the
colour of the plumage, and of smaller dimensions.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Saker</span> (<i>Falco sacer</i>)</p>

<p>The measurements of this hawk, as of a great many others,
are given in the so-called scientific books, even of highest
repute, with hopeless inaccuracy. One of the authorities which
is most often referred to gives the length of the female saker as
18&#189; inches, or the same as the peregrine, whereas every naturalist
ought to know that the saker is a very much larger bird. On
the other hand, the <i>Royal Natural History</i> (1895), coming much
nearer the truth, says that &ldquo;the female falls but little short of
25 inches, and the male measures more than 18&#189;.&rdquo; The proportions
of this hawk, excepting the feet, do not differ greatly
from those of the ger, although the colourings and general
appearance are completely dissimilar. The weak point, from
the falconer&rsquo;s point of view, is the smallness of the feet and
shortness of the middle toe, as well as the poor quality of the
feathers, which have about them none of the glossy smartness
so noticeable in the ger and the peregrine.</p>

<p>Young birds have the crown and nape buffy white, lighter
on the forehead and over the eyebrows, and in other parts profusely
streaked with dark brown. The upper plumage is a
rather dull dark brown, with fulvous and rufous buff edgings.
The tail, excepting the deck feathers, is marked with irregular
oval spots, which range themselves into a sort of band. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span>
is a distinct moustachial stripe. The under parts are buff-coloured,
liberally streaked with splashes of dark brown, especially
on the flanks; but the buff colour grows lighter on the
upper parts, and at the chin becomes nearly white. The cere,
legs, and feet are pale bluish or greenish grey.</p>

<p>In adults the head becomes much lighter, and sometimes
dull white, but with a more or less rufous brown tint and
streaks of darker colour. The upper parts are dull and rather
pale brown, the feathers margined, and in some parts barred,
with light fulvous buff. The flight feathers are faintly barred
with a lighter brown, and all the tail feathers barred with light
buff. The sides of the face, chin, throat, and breast are nearly
white, the latter being spotted rather than streaked with brown,
but not transversely barred. The moustachial streak fades
away. The cere, feet, and legs assume a more or less pronounced
yellow colour.</p>

<p>The saker is a tolerably common bird throughout almost the
whole of Central and Southern Asia, and is there very highly
valued for practical purposes. It was also largely imported
into Western Europe in the Middle Ages, and later it was
used even in France and England for the flight at kites. It is
for this fine sport that it is now chiefly prized in India. The
list of quarry taken by this very serviceable hawk is extremely
large, and includes, besides the various kinds of tropical kites,
hubara, or bustard, herons, black ibis, ducks, and a whole
host of smaller birds. The flight at the short-eared owl is
especially fine, and the quarry often rings, and attains to
a very great height before the saker can get up. The female
saker will take hares well, and also ravine deer.</p>

<p>The tiercel of the saker is more properly called a sakret,
sakeret, or sackeret. This hawk is the largest of those called
desert-hawks or desert-falcons.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Lanner</span> (<i>Falco lanarius</i>)</p>

<p>Female&mdash;Length, 18 inches; wing, 13.3; tail, 7.2. Male or
&ldquo;Lanneret&rdquo;&mdash;Length, 16&#189; inches; wing, 12; tail, 6&#189;.</p>

<p>The dimensions of this desert-hawk do not differ widely
from those of the peregrine, but the feet are much smaller, and
the tail longer. The feathers are of an inferior quality, and the
light colour of the head prevents all risk of confusion. The
wings are slightly longer and heavier. Young birds have the
whole back up to the nape of the neck and down to the tail
coverts dark brown, each feather tipped with a lighter and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span>
more rufous brown. Wing and tail feathers darker brown,
narrowly tipped with rufous buff. The deck feathers are plain,
but the others are barred with lighter brown on the upper
surface, and with dull brownish grey bands of two shades
underneath. The crown of the head is light greyish buff, with
narrow streaks of light brown. The lower plumage is more or
less dull white, very variously marked in different individuals,
but generally with longitudinal splashes of more or less dark
brown. The change to the adult plumage is not very marked.
The breast markings do not change to transverse bars; but
some old birds have the brown markings so arranged as to
appear like irregular bars. These markings, however, generally
become very sparse, and often disappear entirely on the throat
and upper breast. The upper plumage alters to a slatey brownish
grey, most of the feathers being barred with a darker brown,
and still tipped with a rufous line. The cere and feet change
from a bluish to a yellowish grey.</p>

<p>The lanner is common in North Africa, as well as in
Central and Southern Asia, and is very frequently trained and
flown in all these parts of the world. It was also formerly very
largely imported into England, and used chiefly for game-hawking.
It enjoys, nevertheless, anything but a good character.
The old English writers describe it as &ldquo;slothful and
hard mettled,&rdquo; and of an &ldquo;ungrateful disposition,&rdquo; while the
French characterise it as <i>vilain</i> and <i>rebelle</i>. The Indian and
Afghan falconers get it, as well as the saker, into condition by
frequent physicking; and the list of drugs formerly used for it
in England is of portentous length. In modern times the
dosing of this as well as other hawks is imperfectly understood
by European falconers; and the lanner is consequently
in most cases a disappointing bird. When thrown off, she
flies in a heavy style, and only after considerable delay will
begin to mount. Very often, too, she will not mount at all,
but go to perch on a tree, or even on the ground. She is apt to
rake away and check at pigeons, plovers, and what not, and to
be dull and obstinately slow at coming to the lure. To ensure
obedience she must be fed a good deal upon washed meat, and
that in moderate quantities, her appetite, like that of all the
desert-falcons, being apt to grow slack on the least overfeeding.
The lanner is very partial to mice, and in the wild state appears
to devour lizards and other reptiles. She is not, therefore, at
all particular as to diet, and may be regaled with coarser food
than the nobler falcons.</p>

<p>Once properly conditioned, however, and &ldquo;on her day,&rdquo; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">« 25 »</a></span>
lanner&mdash;or for that matter the lanneret, as the male is called&mdash;is
a useful and deadly hawk. Both sexes will kill partridges
freely, not waiting on so often when the quarry has put in as
taking perch on a neighbouring tree, and waiting, like a sparrow-hawk,
to start from there. The female has also been known to
take wild-duck well, and will wait on, when she likes, at a
stupendous height. For magpies the lanner would hardly be
quick enough. Pheasants can usually be taken by the females
at the first stoop. It is said that the Arabs fly the lanner at
small gazelles and a kind of bustard, which it stoops at whenever
it takes wing, and without actually striking it, frightens it
on to its legs, so that it can be run down with hounds. This
bird has the faculty of ejecting a slimy matter from its mouth
and vent, which, if it reached the hawk, would incapacitate her
from flying. Ringing flights are flown at a bird called the
chakhah, resembling a golden plover; and the lanners which
excel at this fetch a price equivalent to £50 or £60. The
Arabs also fly the lanner at sand-grouse and francolin.</p>

<p>D&rsquo;Arcussia declares that the sakers and lanners do better in
stormy weather and high winds than the peregrine. Neither
of them bear the heat well in temperate climates.</p>

<p class="pmt2">The <span class="smcap">South African Lanner</span> (<i>F. biarmicus</i>) and the
<span class="smcap">Tunisian Lanner</span>, or <span class="smcap">Alphanet</span>, are local species, having a
more strongly rufous coloration than <i>F. lanarius</i>.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Lugger</span> (<i>Falco jugger</i>)</p>

<p>Female&mdash;Length, 17 inches; wing, 13.6; tail, 8. Male&mdash;Length,
15 inches; wing, 12; tail, 7.</p>

<p>An Indian hawk, rarely found out of the peninsula. It is
much used by the natives for a variety of quarry, and does a
lot of useful work.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Eleonora Falcon</span> (<i>Falco eleonoræ</i>)</p>

<p>Female&mdash;Length, about 15&#189; inches; wing, 13.3; tail, 7.5.
Male&mdash;Length, about 13&#189; inches; wing, 11.8; tail, 6.5.</p>

<p>This is a hawk of the hobby type, much darker on the under
parts, and with a good deal of black and rufous on the under
surface of the wings. The feet are at first pale yellow, developing
later into orange. The wings are long, but do not project,
like the hobby&rsquo;s, beyond the tail.</p>

<p>This hawk is common on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
It was observed and reported upon by Brooke in
Sardinia, and Kruper in Greece, which latter observes that it is
&ldquo;a noble falcon, and was in early ages used for falconry.&rdquo; I have
not discovered the chapter or verse in which this use is mentioned;
but the hawk is obviously quite big enough to be flown
at partridges, if willing to go. Both the above-named naturalists
maintain that its food consists principally of birds, and Dr.
Kruper declares that he found in its nests the remains of six
different kinds of bird, including quail and hoopoe. A specimen
was trained by Lord Lilford in 1868, who found it very obedient
to the lure, but of no use in the field.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Hobby</span> (<i>Falco sabbuteo</i>)</p>

<p>Female&mdash;Length, 13 to 13&#189; inches; wing, 11&#188;; tail, 6&#188;.
Male&mdash;Length, 11 to 12 inches; wing, about 10&#189;; tail, 5&#189;.</p>

<p>This very beautiful and graceful little hawk may at once
be identified by the exceeding length of its wings, which,
when closed, extend a full half-inch beyond the end of the tail.
It is conspicuous also by its very marked colouring, which is in
young birds almost black on the upper parts, each feather, however,
being tipped with fulvous brown. The lower plumage is
creamy white, streaked profusely with dark brown splashes, and
tinted on the throat and sides of the head with a warm buff.
There is a broad black patch below the eye, and a black eyebrow,
with a small streak of buff above it. The moustache is
broad and strongly marked. The cere is greenish grey; and
the feet, originally of the same hue, develop gradually into light
yellow, and later into gamboge and bright orange. The deck
feathers are plain, but all the others are barred both above and
below by about ten cross-bands of lighter brown.</p>

<p>In adults the upper plumage changes to a uniform dark
slate colour, nearly black towards the head. The flanks and
thighs, especially in the male, assume a more and more distinct
rufous colour. The feet are proportionately small, and the legs
decidedly weak.</p>

<p>There are strong evidences that the hobby, when commonly
bred in Western Europe, was used with success for
taking larks, not only by the process of &ldquo;daring&rdquo; referred to
later on in the chapter on lark-hawking, but in actual flight, and
that the female was used for taking partridges in the same way.
The failure of modern falconers to make any practical use of this
elegant and prepossessing hawk, is noticed in detail in the same
chapter. Owing to its natural tameness, the hobby is especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span>
liable to fall a victim to persecution by gamekeepers and naturalists,
and has as a result been nearly exterminated in England.</p>

<p>A wild hobby has been seen by credible witnesses to take a
swift on the wing in Bulgaria. A trained female has been
known in England to take house-pigeons.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Merlin</span> (<i>Falco æsalon</i>)</p>

<p>Female&mdash;Length, 11&#189; to 12 inches; wing, 8&#189; to 9; tail, 5&#188;
to 5&#190;; weight, about 8 oz. Male&mdash;Length, 10&#189; to 11 inches;
wing, 8 to 8&#188;; tail, 4&#190; to 5; weight, 6&#188; to 6&#190; oz.</p>

<p>Females and young males have the whole upper plumage a
rich chocolate brown, with reflections of purplish grey, each
feather on the back and upper wing coverts tipped with a somewhat
lighter brown, and crossed by a buff bar, which is usually
not to be seen except when the plumage is disarranged or ruffled.
Each feather also has a black shaft, which is conspicuous in
strong lights on a close view. The primaries and all the principal
feathers of the wing are very dark brown on the upper
surface, barred with several patches of light brown or buff. The
under surface of the wing is very light silvery grey, with numerous
bars and spots of brownish grey, each feather having a dark
grey shaft, which is white underneath. The tail feathers on the
upper surface are of a slightly lighter brown than the back, and
light grey underneath, barred with more or less oblique bands,
which are buff-coloured above, and light grey-brown underneath,
and are all tipped with white. The under plumage of the body
is creamy white, more or less tinged with light buff, especially
on the sides of the head and throat. It is liberally streaked with
longitudinal splashes of dark brown, which on the upper throat
are very small, but on the lower flanks are broad and large.
There is a facial patch and a moustache of dark brown, but
these are not so strongly marked as in the peregrine and
hobby. The beak is light blue, darkening to indigo, and at
the tip to black. The cere and eyelids, light bluish grey. The
legs and feet vary from light greenish or blueish grey to light
yellow. The toes are long, thin, and flexible.</p>

<p>Adult females do not change, except that they lose much or
all of the purplish sheen of nestlings, and that the edging of the
feathers is less marked. Adult males undergo a very striking
transformation. The whole upper plumage changes from brown
to a rich bluish slate colour, deepening in the long wing feathers
to greyish black. Instead of the light bars on the tail, there
is a single broad grey-black band nearly at the extreme end.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span>
The breast at the same time assumes a warmer tint, deepening
from cream colour at the chin to a rich buff lower down, and
deep russet at the flanks. The cere, eyelids, legs, and feet
assume a deep golden or light orange colour. The wing and
tail feathers have a stronger and stiffer appearance than before
the moult, and those of the tail are generally somewhat shorter
as well as stouter than they were. Very old females occasionally,
but not often, put on the livery of the adult male; and
this is the case sometimes also with old female kestrels. In
merlins of both sexes the third feather of the wing is usually
exactly equal in length to the second, and it is only exceptionally
that it is even fractionally shorter.</p>

<p>The name merlin is in orthodox phraseology reserved to the
female merlin only, the male being more properly spoken of as
a jack. The former, when exceptionally strong and courageous,
may be flown with some success at partridges, and will also take
house-pigeons and probably doves. They have been known to
capture and kill wood-pigeons. Both sexes may be flown at
quails, and are more deadly at this business than sparrow-hawks.
In the wild state they kill blackbirds, thrushes, starlings, and
almost all kinds of small birds, and the trained birds may be
kept with more or less success to any one of these birds of
quarry. It has been thought that a good cast of merlins might
take snipe, and it is said that such a feat has been in former
times achieved. With tropical snipe in an overfed or moulting
condition, it is possible that this might still be done; but it is
to be greatly doubted whether any trained merlin or merlins
could take fully-moulted English snipe. The flight, however,
for which merlins are usually reserved, and for which they are
renowned, is that at moulting skylarks, and in this sport the
jacks are very nearly as successful as their sisters, as will be
seen in the chapter on lark-hawking. The merlin will follow
her quarry when she can into covert; and when her victim is
larger than herself, kills it by strangulation, gripping it tightly
round the neck.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Indian Merlin</span> (<i>Falco chicquera</i>)</p>

<p>This hawk, a little larger than the European merlin, is flown
at much the same quarry, but also at rollers and hoopoes, which
latter afford a fine ringing flight.</p>

<p class="pmt2">The <span class="smcap">African Merlin</span> (<i>F. ruficollis</i>) has the markings on
the breast closer together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">« 29 »</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Kestrel</span> (<i>Falco tinnunculus</i>)</p>

<p>Female&mdash;Length, about 13 inches; wing, 9; tail, 7. Male&mdash;Length,
about 12 inches; wing, 8&#188;; tail, 6&#189;.</p>

<p>Females and young males have the upper plumage reddish
brown, transversely barred on the shoulders, wing coverts, and
tail with black; the flight feathers, blackish brown; the under
plumage, very pale fawn colour, streaked on the breast, and
splashed on the lower part with brown. Adult males have the
head, lower part of the back, and upper surface of tail, light
slatey grey. The tail with a broad black band near the end, and
tipped with white; and the head with dark shaft-streaks; the
shoulders, upper back, and upper wing coverts, pale chestnut,
with small black spots of a triangular shape. The wings, dark
horn colour, with lighter edging. The under plumage, pale
fawn colour, becoming more rufous at the lower part and on
the thighs; streaked with dark brown splashes on the breast,
and spots on the abdomen. The cere, feet, and legs are pale
greyish yellow in the young, and brighter in the adult.</p>

<p>This little hawk has, structurally, all the characteristics of
what the naturalists call a true falcon&mdash;more so, in fact, than
the more highly reputed merlin. Its shape, indeed, but for a
want of size in the feet and a somewhat exaggerated length of
tail, is very symmetrical, and indicative of fine flying powers.
It is the least shy and most familiar of all European hawks,
and survives in tolerably large numbers throughout England,
where, together with the owls, it is a chief agent in keeping
down the inordinate increase of mice. Its powers of flight are
very considerable; and it remains on the wing generally for a
considerable part of the day, not soaring so much as beating the
ground at a height of two or three score feet, and hovering from
time to time with its eye on any small creature that may be
moving about or hiding in the grass below. But notwithstanding
its fine proportions, its muscular power is not great, and its
extreme pace is not to be compared with that of the merlin. If
pursued by a fairly good peregrine in a pretty open place, it
frequently succumbs.</p>

<p>In the field a kestrel is of no practical use. It will indeed
generally take sparrows and other small birds thrown up from
the hand when it is waiting on. And instances have been
known where it has flown and taken a few wild birds. There
is even a story extant of an eyess kestrel which was flown at
a young partridge and took it. But these facts, if true, must
have been entirely exceptional. As a rule the trained kestrel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">« 30 »</a></span>
refuses all wild quarry, and it has never been known to persevere
in killing any. I am not sure whether a fair attempt has been
made to fly her at rats, which would probably afford the best
chance. But kestrels can be reclaimed and taught to fly to the
lure in exactly the same way as the proudest peregrine or the
most majestic ger. They will wait on beautifully, and stoop
very prettily at the lure. And while at hack their movements
are exceedingly lively and graceful. Thus for a beginner the
kestrel is, in my opinion, undoubtedly the most suitable hawk
upon which he can try his hand. In the breeding season eyesses
may be procured pretty easily, and at an insignificant cost; and
throughout the year many of both sexes are captured in the
nets of bird-catchers, who would part with them readily for a
few shillings if they were notified beforehand that any amateur
would give a fair price for the captives. In reclaiming and
manning a kestrel, in learning how to keep her feathers unbroken
and clean, how to hood her, bathe her, house her, and
weather her, and how to diet her, the tyro can very easily
and cheaply acquire all that elementary knowledge of the
difficult art of falconry which it is advisable that he should
possess before he attempts to succeed in training and flying a
valuable hawk. Whereas if, without any preliminary experience,
he begins, as so many writers advise him, with an eyess merlin,
he is almost certain to meet with a more or less discouraging
failure. Far better to observe the old maxim, &ldquo;<i>Fiat experimentum
in corpore vili</i>.&rdquo; Let the young falconer not attempt
to run before he can walk fairly well. When he has taught his
kestrel to wait on and stoop to the lure, and has either by
preventive care or by successful imping got her in perfect
plumage, let him feed her up and &ldquo;whistle her down the wind&rdquo;
to shift for herself, and then consider himself qualified to
make a more serious attempt with a sparrow-hawk, merlin, or
peregrine.</p>

<p class="caption3">II. THE SHORT-WINGED HAWKS</p>

<p>Regarded from the falconer&rsquo;s point of view, the short-winged
hawk differs essentially from her more honourable cousin of the
long wings in the following particulars. She cannot be taught
to &ldquo;wait on&rdquo; in the air. Although she will on occasions stoop
from above at her quarry, she does not habitually capture it by
a downward stroke or blow, but by following it from behind
and &ldquo;trussing&rdquo; or &ldquo;binding&rdquo; to it. She manifests her readiness
to fly by a condition of body which is called by the quaint, and
apparently Oriental, name of &ldquo;yarak,&rdquo; in which she shows evident
signs of eagerness and excitement, and is obviously on the <i>qui
vive</i>&mdash;attentive to every sight and sound which she may suppose
to indicate the presence of quarry or the hope of a flight. She
kills her quarry, when taken, by crushing it in her strong foot
and piercing it with her long and sharp claws, or pounces. She
follows her quarry, when it is possible, into covert; and when
this is not possible she takes stand readily on some convenient
resting-place, such as the branch of a tree, the top of a wall, or
on her trainer&rsquo;s fist. As a general rule she does not need to be
kept to any one particular quarry, or flown at any particular
time of day, but may be thrown off at anything, whether fur
or feather, which she thinks she can take, and will do almost
any amount of work at almost any hour.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that though, from the purely artistic
and sporting standpoint, the long-winged hawk deserves the
more honourable place which has always been accorded to her
in the most civilised countries, yet, taking the more material
and matter-of-fact view of the matter, and regarded as a &ldquo;pot-hunter,&rdquo;
the short-winged is at least equal to her in merit.
There is, it is true, in the flight of the latter little of the
grandeur and dramatic excitement which so often attend the
efforts of the former. No silent pause while the pointer stands
and the hawk mounts steadily to her lofty pride of place above
him. No spiral climbing of quarry and hawk into the distant
blue sky. No lightning descent, which in a second or two
brings down the hawk from hundreds of yards high to within a
few feet of her trainer&rsquo;s head. But there is plenty of excitement
of a different and not less healthy kind. The wary
stalking of a shy quarry while the well-trained hawk on the
fist trembles with eagerness for the chase. The rush and bustle
of the start; the quick burst of riding or running to keep the
chase in view; the hurry and scurry when the quarry has to be
routed out from his place of refuge; the tussle for mastery
when he has once been seized; and, last but not least, the
abundance and variety of the bag which on a successful day is
carried home.</p>

<p>One very great advantage attached to the short-winged
hawk is that she can be flown in an enclosed country, or at
least in places which are only very moderately open. Woods
and forests are of course tabooed; and any land which is very
undulating or very steep should be avoided. But the grass land
and arable land which is commonly found in some four-fifths of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">« 32 »</a></span>
the area of England, and especially that part of it which is not
cut up into too small fields, is available, as well as the downs
and commons, even though an occasional spinny or small
plantation intrudes itself into the campaigning ground. Another
merit of the short-winged hawk is that she is less likely to be
lost. Trained as she is, or should be, upon missing her quarry,
to come back to the falconer himself, and remain with him until
her quarry is again actually on the wing, or, in the case of
ground-game, on its legs, there is little temptation either to
&ldquo;rake away&rdquo; or to &ldquo;check.&rdquo; Again, the length of the flights,
counting each separate bout in the pursuit as a flight, is very
much less; so that the falconer&mdash;or ostringer, to give him his
correct name&mdash;has a far better chance of keeping in sight
when the quarry is either taken or put in. Finally, neither
of the species of short-winged hawks usually trained and flown
is much addicted to the vice of &ldquo;carrying&rdquo;; and thus the risk
of losing a hawk or wasting valuable time by reason of this
vexatious habit is much less to be feared. It should perhaps
be added that constant exercise is less necessary for a short-winged
than for a long-winged hawk, as the former may
be left idle for considerable periods, and when brought into
yarak again seems to have lost little if any of her speed or her
merits.</p>

<p>At the same time, the temper and disposition of the short-winged
hawks are undeniably worse at the first than those of
the long-winged. Both goshawks and sparrow-hawks, whether
eyesses or wild caught, are naturally suspicious and mistrustful
of mankind. They are easily alarmed, and very ready to take
offence, and, once alienated or frightened, can with difficulty be
conciliated. Savage and vindictive by nature and habit, they
are subject to almost ungovernable fits of rage and sulkiness,
which can only be subdued and guarded against by the exercise
of much patience and good temper on the part of the trainer.
They are jealous and cruel, and cannot, as a rule, be flown in
company with other hawks, even of their own species and sex.
Once lost for any considerable time they resort to their wild
habits, and are difficult to recapture. Unless carefully dieted
they are very subject to apoplectic fits. Their long tails,
although flexible and elastic under moderate pressure, will not
always stand a very severe strain, and are likely, in a serious
struggle either with any big quarry or with an awkward trainer,
to be broken. The short-winged hawks should generally be
belled on the tail. They are apt sometimes to crouch down
on their quarry when taken, in which case a bell on the leg
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span>
is hardly sounded. Besides this, if flown when snow is on the
ground, the snow will choke the bell and make it useless.</p>

<p>Taking the whole world over, the families of the goshawks
and sparrow-hawks, which practically merge into one another,
are very extensive, comprising more than thirty species, many
of which could without doubt be pressed into the service of man.
Only three of these have, however, commonly been trained.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Goshawk</span> (<i>Astur palumbarius</i>)</p>

<p>Female&mdash;Length, 22 to 24 inches; wing, 12&#189; to 13&#189;; tail,
10 to 12; tarsus, about 3.5. Male&mdash;Length, 19&#189; to 21&#189; inches;
wing, 10&#188; to 12&#189;; tail, 9 to 10; tarsus, about 3.</p>

<p>Females and young males have the upper plumage a dull
liver brown, broadly margined and barred with much lighter
brown; the tail, barred with five broad bands, dark brown.
The under surface of the tail is pale whitish grey, with five
bands of dark brownish grey. The rest of the under plumage
is pale or rusty cream colour, tinted more or less faintly with
salmon pink, and streaked irregularly on the breast and flanks
with longitudinal patches or splashes of dark brown. The cere
and legs are greenish yellow. The eyes are very light, and
clear yellowish grey, and so bright that the Greeks gave to this
hawk the name of <!--[Greek: asterias ierax]-->
&#7937;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#7985;&#945;&#962; &#7985;&#949;&#961;&#7937;&#958;,
the star-eyed hawk. Adult
males have a decided grey tint on the upper and under plumage.
At the first moult both sexes change the longitudinal streaks on
the breast, thighs, and flanks into more or less irregular bars of
dark greyish brown; and as they grow older the bars usually
become narrower and more regular. The tail is now barred on
both surfaces with four broad bands of dark brown or grey.
The cere, legs, and feet become yellow; and the eyes change to
a deeper yellow, and ultimately to deeper and darker orange.</p>

<p>Goshawks vary greatly in size and strength. Those which
are imported from Norway are often exceptionally big and
strong, while the specimens from Germany and Central Europe
have a reputation for weakness. Although this hawk formerly
bred commonly in England, it is now practically extinct; but
some nests are still annually found in France.</p>

<p>The list of quarry at which the goshawk may be flown is
very large, including, for the British islands, hares, rabbits, stoats,
weasels, squirrels, and rats; herons and wild ducks&mdash;flown as
they rise&mdash;pheasants, partridges, landrails, water-hens, jays, and
an occasional magpie or wood-pigeon. In fact, any moderate-sized
bird which gets up close in front of a goshawk must bustle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">« 34 »</a></span>
himself if he intends to escape the first quick dash of this
impetuous and greedy pursuer.</p>

<p>In India and other tropical countries the female &ldquo;goss&rdquo; will
fly, with a good start, at crows, neophrons, minas, florikin,
francolin, jungle-fowl, and even such big birds as kites, geese,
cranes, and pea-fowl. Even in England she was formerly flown
with success at cranes, wild geese, and other large water-fowl;
and the old books contain elaborate directions as to stalking
these birds &ldquo;with grey goshawk on hand.&rdquo; In some parts of Asia
goshawks are said to have been flown at ravine deer and
bustard; but this would probably be with some assistance from
dogs.</p>

<p>The male goshawk, much smaller in size than his sisters, is
less valuable to the sportsman, but is usually accounted rather
swifter on the wing. The best specimens will catch a partridge
in fair flight; and most of them, with a tolerably good start,
will overtake a pheasant. A very strong male will sometimes
catch and hold a full-grown rabbit, and the others may be
expected to kill half-grown rabbits and leverets, if kept to such
quarry. Landrails and water-hens make a more or less easy
flight. Jays and magpies may sometimes be taken, as well as
blackbirds. Rats, weasels, squirrels, and &ldquo;such small deer&rdquo; are,
of course, available. Occasional specimens of the male goshawk
are extraordinarily fast and strong. Colonel Delmé Radcliffe
had one which actually killed grouse in Scotland, and another
which took storks and geese in India, as well as partridges.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Sparrow-Hawk</span> (<i>Accipiter nisus</i>)</p>

<p>Female&mdash;Length, 14 to 16 inches; wing, 8&#189; to 9&#189;; tail, 7&#189;
to 7&#190;; tarsus, 2.4. Male&mdash;Length, 11&#189; to 12&#189; inches; wing,
7&#189; to 8&#188;; tail, 6 to 6&#189;; tarsus, 2.1.</p>

<p>The sparrow-hawk is remarkable for its very long and
slender legs and middle toe, and its small head. Young females
have the beak and upper plumage sepia brown, each feather
edged with rufous brown; the nape varied with white or rufous
white. The wing feathers are dark brown, with five bars of still
darker brown on the outer primaries. The tail rather lighter
brown, with five dark brown bars. The under plumage is dull
white, more or less tinged with rufous, spotted with irregular
patches, streaks, or bars of greyish brown. In the adult the
brown of the upper plumage assumes a slatey grey hue, and the
edgings of lighter colour vanish. The breast and under parts
are barred with transverse markings of mixed fulvous and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">« 35 »</a></span>
brown, and develop a rusty red colouring on the abdomen
and inner thighs. The legs and feet become more distinctly
yellow or gold colour, and the eye deepens in colour to
light and ultimately to dark orange. Males in the immature
plumage differ from females only in having a somewhat more
rufous hue on the lighter part. But after the moult this rufous
colouring becomes still more conspicuous, and spreads to the
flanks and under surface of the wings, as well as to the upper
throat. In both sexes the bars on the breast and thighs become
narrower and of a fainter grey as the birds grow older; and the
eyes deepen in colour.</p>

<p>Female sparrow-hawks&mdash;very much bigger and stronger than
their brothers&mdash;may be flown at any bird of the size of a partridge,
or smaller, which is not very swift or quick in shifting. In
the wild state they undoubtedly kill a certain number of wood-pigeons,
taking them at some disadvantage, as, for instance,
when they pass under a tree in which the hawk is at perch.
Probably the wild sparrow-hawk also picks up an occasional
peewit, snipe, or woodcock. She is fond of young pheasants,
which she will pick up from the ground when insufficiently
guarded by the mother or foster-mother. Young chickens
sometimes undergo the same fate under similar circumstances.
The uses of the trained sparrow-hawk, both male and female,
are described in the chapter devoted to this hawk.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Besra Sparrow-Hawk</span> (<i>Accipiter virgatus</i>)</p>

<p>This species, considerably smaller than <i>A. nisus</i>, is very
common in the tropics, both in the wild and in the trained state,
and is thought by many to be quite equal, if not superior, to it
in courage and ability.</p>

<p>Other sparrow-hawks which may be trained include the large
species called the Levant sparrow-hawk (<i>A. brevipes</i>), <i>A. minullus</i>
and <i>A. tinus</i>, from South America, <i>A. cirrocephalus</i>, from
Australia, <i>A. badius</i>, and the miniature <i>A. polyzonoides</i>.</p>


<p class="caption3">III. THE EAGLES</p>

<p>In Western Europe no great use seems to have been made
by the old falconers of any kind of eagle. D&rsquo;Arcussia in the
early editions of his book makes no reference to them as
objects of the trainer&rsquo;s care, and some of the early English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">« 36 »</a></span>
authors expressly speak of them as useless to the falconer
by reason of their great weight, making it impossible, as
they believed, to carry them on the fist, and also their powers
of fasting, which, they supposed, precluded all chance of
reducing them to proper obedience. In the East, however, they
have from time immemorial been trained with success, and
flown at a great variety of quarry suitable to their size and
strength. For the far greater part of the knowledge which we
now have about flights with eagles, we are indebted to Mr.
J. E. Harting, who obtained much valuable information on this
subject from the late Mr. Constantine Haller, an enthusiastic
falconer, and president of a Russian falconry club which had its
headquarters at St. Petersburg in 1884-85. Notwithstanding
the efforts of these two very competent authorities, it is still
exceedingly difficult to say with any certainty what sorts of
eagles are now employed by the Kirghis and Turcomans and
other Asiatic peoples, and what other sorts are regarded as
unserviceable. As to the golden eagle and Bonelli&rsquo;s eagle
there is no doubt; but the evidence as to the others below-mentioned
cannot be said to be at all conclusive.</p>

<p>The speed of the eagles in ordinary flying is inferior to that
of the hawks, though superior to that of any quadruped at his
best pace. Their usual mode of capturing their prey when in
the wild state, is by soaring and scanning the ground below,
and, when they see a good chance, dropping with a powerful
stoop on to the back or head of the victim. In training they
cannot be made to wait on, and must therefore be flown from
the fist, so that winged game of all kinds is usually able to
show them, if not &ldquo;a clean pair of heels,&rdquo; at least a clean set of
tail feathers. Consequently their quarry consists almost entirely
of four-legged creatures. Large birds of various descriptions
might be flown at when they are on the ground, and
might be taken before they had time to get fairly on the
wing; but such masquerades of real hawking can hardly be
called flights.</p>

<p>The golden eagle, and most other eagles, are naturally more
or less ill-tempered, and require the exercise of considerable
patience on the part of the man who undertakes to reclaim
them; but the method employed differs in no material respect
from that applied to the short-winged hawk. Only, when a
goshawk or sparrow-hawk is once properly reclaimed and
manned, she generally says good-bye to her bad temper. The
eagle is said to be sometimes apt, even when fully trained, to
become so enraged, either at missing her quarry or by some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">« 37 »</a></span>
other <i>contretemps</i>, that she will attack the men of the party, and
perhaps have a flight at a native just by way of a relief to her
outraged feelings.</p>

<p>Eagles are carried to and in the field on a crutch, which is
formed of an upright pole with a cross-bar at the top, the lower
end of the apparatus being fitted into the saddle, and the staff
of it attached by a strap to the rider&rsquo;s girdle. The lure, to
which they are called when they do not come back to the
crutch, consists of the stuffed skin of an animal made to
resemble the quarry at which they are meant to fly.</p>

<p class="pmt2">The following are the eagles best fitted for training:&mdash;</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Golden Eagle</span> (<i>Aquila chrysaetus</i>)</p>

<p>Female&mdash;Length, about 35 inches; wing, about 27&#189;; tail,
about 14; tarsus, 3.8. Male&mdash;Length, about 32 inches; wing,
24&#189;; tail, 13; tarsus, 3.7.</p>

<p>The plumage is generally of a ruddy brown or fawn, inclining
in parts to dark brown, and in others to dull brownish gold.
Adult females become very dark, and males also assume a more
dusky hue as they grow older.</p>

<p>Of the fact that the golden eagle is now and has been for
centuries commonly trained and flown in Central Asia there is
no manner of doubt. Many excellent authorities maintain that
it is the species used by the Kirghis and other tribes subject or
tributary to Russia under the name of Kholsan. This was
also the opinion of M. Paul Gervais, who became the owner of a
veritable Kholsan, imported into France by M. Maichin, who
purchased it from the Kirghis for £40 and a gun. This trained
eagle, which was a female, would take foxes well, and after
binding to them was accustomed to grip them by the fore part
of the mask, thus obviating the chance of a dangerous bite. In
Central Asia the Kholsan is flown at bustard, hare, fox, and
antelope; and the females will tackle such heavy quarry as wild
goat, wolf, and even wild boar.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Berkute</span> (<i>Aquila nobilis</i>)</p>

<p>About the identity of this species there is even more doubt
than about the Kholsan. Mr. Harting inclines to the view
that it is no more than a golden eagle in a different phase of its
plumage. Others suppose that it is the imperial eagle, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">« 38 »</a></span>
others again regard it as Bonelli&rsquo;s eagle. It appears that in the
Russian provinces of Asia it is still more commonly used than
the Kholsan, and at much the same quarry, which would
suggest the conclusion that it is not at any rate a larger bird
than <i>A. Bonellii</i>.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">White-Crowned Eagle</span> (<i>Haliætus leucoryphus</i>)</p>

<p>A specimen was owned by a Russian falconer, who found it
worth while to keep it over two moults, and must have taken a
favourable view of its merits.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Spotted Eagle</span> (<i>Aquila clanga</i> or <i>nævia</i>)</p>

<p>This large eagle is trained by the Kirghis, under the name
of Kara Gush, <i>i.e.</i> black eagle.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Imperial Eagle</span> (<i>Aquila imperialis</i>)</p>

<p>This is a smaller eagle than <i>A. chrysaetus</i>, the female
measuring about 32 inches and the male about 31. It appears
to be susceptible of training, and is thought by many to be
included in the list of eagles commonly used in Turkestan. It
is found throughout the greater part of Asia, and occasionally
in South-Eastern Europe.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Steppe Eagle</span> (<i>Aquila nipalensis</i>)</p>

<p>This bird is described by some naturalists as a hawk-eagle.
It is of a taking and sportsmanlike appearance, the eyes of old
specimens being of a fiery yellow, though in young birds they
are dull grey. Colonel D. Radcliffe obtained several specimens
in India, both eyess and wild caught. He says that in the wild
state it takes pine martens and also the musk deer.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Bonelli&rsquo;s Eagle</span> (<i>Aquila Bonellii</i>)</p>

<p>Female&mdash;Length, 26&#189; inches; wing, 18&#188;; tail, 11&#189;; tarsus, 4.
Male&mdash;Length, 24&#189; inches; wing, 17&#189;; tail, 11&#188;; tarsus, 3.9.</p>

<p>This small and rather long-legged eagle is probably the
easiest to train, and the best for purposes of falconry in Europe,
as it is of a more handy size than the bigger species, and strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">« 39 »</a></span>
enough for all practical purposes. A trained specimen was
kept and flown by M. Barachin in France at hares and
rabbits. It is described by Canon Tristram as a more dainty
feeder than most of the eagles; and Mr. Hume says that in
the wild state it kills many water-fowl. The tail is barred.
The weight of the male hardly exceeds 4 lbs.</p>

<p>In concluding the list it must be observed that several birds
which might have been comprised in it are omitted. The
Chinese and Japanese falconers of bygone times undoubtedly
trained hawks which are figured in their books, but cannot now
be identified. Falconry is extinct in Japan, and nearly so in
China. The hawks themselves, which were once highly honoured
in their country, will probably before long be exterminated by
the ever-increasing horde of skin-collectors.</p>

<p>Some readers may be surprised at the exclusion from this
list of some such birds as vultures, buzzards, and even some
owls. These I have designedly omitted. I find in a work
called the <i>Natural History Picture-Book</i> a statement by Mr.
Wood, that the kite (<i>Milvus regalis</i>) &ldquo;has even been trained
for purposes of falconry, and found to perform its task to
the satisfaction of its owner.&rdquo; Either the owner must have
been very easily pleased, or the kite must have changed very
greatly in disposition and habits within the last few centuries!
With shrikes the case is different, for it appears that they were
actually trained to fly at small birds. D&rsquo;Arcussia tells us
plainly that amongst the numerous hawking establishments
kept up by Louis <span class="smcap">XIII.</span> was one of shrikes, and relates a very
quaint story of one of these little birds owned by the king,
which would fly up to a heron on the wing and whisper in
his ear!</p>

<p>Several of the falconets might certainly be utilised in the
field, and amongst them especially Feilden&rsquo;s falcon, which is
very common, very bold, and very tame. Indeed, some of the
Malays are said to train these little hawks. Davison says that
he has seen the black-legged falconet (<i>Hierax fringillarius</i>)
stoop at a rock-thrush, and killed one on a partly-plucked
swallow. Other likely varieties are the white-legged and red-legged
falconets (<i>H. melanoleucus</i> and <i>H. c&oelig;rulescens</i>).</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that such birds as fly-catchers
could be trained and flown at butterflies; and possibly, when
the naturalists and Cockney sportsmen and egg-collectors have
succeeded by their united efforts in exterminating all hawks,
our descendants may resort to this form of sport as their best
substitute for falconry as we now know it.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Furniture and Fittings</span></p>


<p>Before the intending falconer takes any preliminary steps
even towards becoming the owner of a hawk, he must
make himself thoroughly familiar with the necessary appliances
which he will have to use, and first of all with the hawk&rsquo;s
furniture, or articles of attire and daily use.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;jess&rdquo; (or jesse) by which the hawk&rsquo;s feet are secured is
a strip of leather fastened round the leg, just above the foot. It
is, of course, of a different length, width, and stoutness, according
to the size of the wearer. For a peregrine or ger the same
stuff may be used as for strong riding or driving gloves; and
the softer and more pliable it can be, consistently with strength,
the better. For a gerfalcon 8 in. is not too long. For a
peregrine tiercel 6&#189; in. is long enough, and for hawks of intermediate
size the length may vary according to their proportions.
In the case of the smaller hawks, from the female sparrow-hawk
to the tiny jack-merlin, the length for ordinary purposes should
be from 4&#189; in. to 6&#189; in. But when a jack-merlin is flying ringing
larks late in the season, or indeed at any time, and it is important
that he should carry the very smallest possible amount of
extra luggage, his jesses may be made out of a thin kid glove,
well stretched and greased, and need not be more than 3&#189; in.
long, by &#188; in. wide, bulging out to &#8531; in. at the place where
they encircle the leg, and at the other end, where they are
hooked to the swivel. In all cases the jess is attached in
the same way. After it has been well stretched and greased,
a short slit is made near the broader end of the leather (see
<a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1</a>), and another a little farther down. The distance
between the two slits should be about the same as the circumference
of the hawk&rsquo;s leg&mdash;not greater, nor much less. This
part of the leather between the two slits is applied to the
hawk&rsquo;s leg, and the shorter end, being brought round the
leg, is pushed through the second slit as far as it will go. Then
the longer end is in its turn passed through the first slit and
pulled tight. Some falconers pass the long end of the jess
through both slits before pulling it tight; but the reason for this
extra precaution has never been made plain. After the long end
has been pulled through&mdash;or before, if preferred&mdash;a hole is
punched in the leather at a short distance from the tip, and
another and larger slit is made for the purpose of attaching the
jess to the swivel. But if the hawk is destined, immediately
after the jesses have been put on, to be turned out to hack, this
end slit is not required, and should never be made, as it is
possible that it might loop itself round some thorn or other peg-like
object, and hang up the hawk, causing her death or some
irreparable injury. Whenever a jess is released from the swivel,
it is a good plan, when there is time, to twirl up the end, rolling
it between the finger and thumb, so that the slit does not form
a loop. It is then less likely, in case of the hawk being lost, to
lead to a misfortune of the kind referred to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">« 41 »</a></span></p>

<p>Trained hawks always wear jesses. As soon as one pair is
worn, and shows signs of weakness, another pair should be put
on; and after they are attached, the old ones may be cut off
with a sharp knife or scissors and thrown away. Valuable
hawks have been lost by the owner&rsquo;s neglect to renew the
jesses. Of course it usually happens that one of a pair wears
out before the other, and the breaking of the weakest gives
warning before the other has given way. But when one jess
has become so dilapidated as to be on the point of breaking,
his fellow will not be in a much better case, and a jerk caused
by suddenly bating at the block, especially when sitting
there after a bath, may liberate the hawk when you feel least
prepared for such a mishap. The old falconers seem to have
almost always attached the ends of the jesses to &ldquo;varvels,&rdquo;
which were small rings of silver, or other metal, upon which
often the name and address of the owner were engraved.
Possibly the jesses so used were very short, so that the risk of
&ldquo;hooking up&rdquo; did not arise. But the practice has long been
abandoned by European falconers.</p>

<p>Bells for trained hawks are of the greatest possible use.
They betray the whereabouts of the wearer, and save an infinity
of time and trouble when she has killed out of sight; and
besides this, they proclaim to every stranger who sees a lost
hawk on the wing that she is private property, and not wild.
They are, practically, no impediment to the hawk&rsquo;s flight,
except in the case of the very smallest species; and their sound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">« 42 »</a></span>
probably augments the terror inspired in the quarry by a stoop
that has only just missed its mark. Bells have been used in all
countries from time immemorial. The best are now made in
India; but for the larger hawks, those supplied by Mr. Möllen,
at Valkenswaard, in Holland, are good enough, and very cheap.
The European bells are spherical, with a plain flat shank (<a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a>),
and those of Indian manufacture are of the shape shown
in the illustration (<a href="#fig_3">Fig. 3</a>). Anciently, silver was much used for
bells for the more valuable hawks, but the metal now used is
chiefly brass. A good bell should be capable of being heard
distinctly on a still day more than a quarter of a mile, even if
lightly moved. The bell is attached to the hawk&rsquo;s leg by a
&ldquo;bewit,&rdquo; which is fastened on in the same way as the jess. The
bewit is a small strip of leather shaped as in <a href="#fig_5">Fig. 5</a>. It is
pulled through the shank of the bell until the latter is at the
place indicated by the dotted line near the middle. The shank
is applied to the hawk&rsquo;s leg above the jess, and the end (A) is
passed round the leg and pushed through the slit (B). Then
the thicker end is pushed through the slit at the thin end,
and pulled till the ears or jags at the side have come through
the opening. These then act as barbs to prevent the end
slipping back, and the thin part of it can be cut off. Hack
bells are used not only to give notice where the hawk is,
but also to serve as a weight to handicap her when, at the
end of her time of liberty, she begins to chase chance quarry.
They are therefore much bigger, in proportion to the size of
the wearer, than the bells used in the field. A falcon&rsquo;s or tiercel&rsquo;s
bell will not be too big for a merlin or jack. Sometimes hawks'
bells are even loaded with lead. A merlin which is flying
ringing larks does not wear bells, for it is impossible to get
any which are sufficiently light, and at the same time loud
enough to be of any use.</p>

<p>Short-winged hawks should generally be belled on the tail,
and for this purpose the bewits should be of a different shape,
as in <a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4</a>. The aperture on each side of the bewit should be
made to encircle the shaft of one of the &ldquo;deck&rdquo; feathers, that is,
the central feathers of the tail, near to its base; and the double
ends (C, C) should be lapped or tied together with waxed thread,
so that the fastening cannot slip from its place.</p>

<p>Of course when it is intended to put on new jesses or bewits,
the hawk must be &ldquo;cast,&rdquo; or held. And some considerable
attention is required to cast a hawk properly. To seize an
unhooded hawk, especially short-winged, and forcibly thrust her
down on her breast would constitute, in her eyes, a deadly and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">« 43 »</a></span>
perhaps unpardonable offence. To meddle with her when she
has a full crop would be a great mistake. A time should be
chosen when she has little or nothing in her crop. She should
be hooded and held on the fist, while on the &ldquo;operating table&rdquo;
is placed a cushion and the apparatus required, including
tweezers and a sharp penknife. Then a silk handkerchief,
once folded, can be thrown over the hawk&rsquo;s shoulders, and the
falconer&rsquo;s assistant, standing behind the hawk with his hands
over her back, the thumbs close to her back-bone, will, with a
quick steady lowering of the palms, grasp her firmly round the
body, with the fingers enclosing the sides of her wings and
thighs. Lifting her off the fist, he must deposit her on the
cushion, holding her down steadily on her breast. A man
should be employed for this purpose who is not likely to
be nervous or flurried.</p>

<p>The jesses are made fast to the swivel when the hawk is not
intended to fly; and swivels are of two kinds. The safest (and
the most troublesome to put on and take off) is the ring-swivel
(<a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6</a>), consisting of a double ring in the shape of a figure 8,
each end working freely on a pivot which keeps the two rings
close together. It is made of brass or iron, and very good and
cheap ones are to be had from Mr. Möllen, of Valkenswaard, in
North Brabant. To attach the ring-swivel to the jesses, pass
the end of one jess from right to left through one of the rings,
and, after it is through, pass both rings through the slit in the
jess, and pull tight. When the first jess is fast, pass the end of
the other jess through the same ring upon which the first jess is
fastened, but in the opposite direction, from left to right, and
then pass the two rings through the slit as before. The second
jess will pull up tight over the first, and both will be fixed
firmly at the outer end of the same ring.</p>

<p>To get the ring-swivel off, the extreme end of the jess which
was last put on must be pulled until that jess becomes slack
enough for the two rings to be passed through it, or, in other
words, for the opening in the leather to be pulled over the
rings, and, this being done, it will come away at once. After
releasing one jess, take care to hold it tight between the fingers
of the left hand while freeing the other jess. Otherwise, if the
hawk is fidgety and jumps off, she may jerk the other jess out of
your hand, and go off bodily, leash and all, into the next parish.</p>

<p>Spring-swivels (<a href="#fig_7">Fig. 7</a>) are very handy contrivances for use
in the field, but not so safe for a hawk when sitting unhooded
on the perch or at the block. They are shaped like the swivel
by which watches are usually attached to a watch-chain, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">« 44 »</a></span>
must be so made as to turn quite freely on the pivot. To
attach them to the jesses, nothing more is required than to press
the side with the thumb-nail, making the spring yield, and then
hook the curved end through the slit in both jesses, after which
the spring is released, and the jesses remain encircled by the
metal. Only, if the spring is stiff or does not work properly,
there will be disasters. The unhooking process is of course
even more easily and quickly effected.</p>

<p>The leash can now be attached to the swivel. And leashes,
again, may be of two kinds. The orthodox leash for peregrines
and big hawks is a strip of tough leather, about half an inch
wide, and a yard long, provided with a stout button at one end,
which is made in the following way:&mdash;In cutting the leash, three
inches or so at one end are cut rather broader than the rest of
the strip. This broad end is then rolled up tightly by doubling
it over and over upon itself. After the broad part has been
rolled up, a hole is punched right through the roll, and the
other end of the leash, which is tapered to a point, is pushed
through and pulled tight. A sort of square button will thus
be formed at the thick end of the leash (<a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a>); and if the thin
end of it is passed through the outer ring of the swivel&mdash;that
ring to which the jesses are not attached&mdash;it will run right
through until the ring encounters the button, which is too big to
get past. The whole length of the leash is then available for
the purpose of tying up the hawk to her block, or to a peg in
the ground.</p>

<p>There is a right and a wrong way about even so simple a
matter as tying up a hawk. Blocks and pegs ought always to be
provided with a ring or staple, round which to tie the leash;
and it should be tied in what is called a falconer&rsquo;s knot, which
can easily be negotiated with one hand. To begin with, pass
the thin end of the leash through the ring. Then make a loop
in the part which has gone through the ring, and pass the loop
round that part of the leash which has not gone through the
ring. Pull tight, and the leash will assume an appearance
resembling that shown in <a href="#fig_9">Fig. 9</a>. Next pass the end (A)
through the loop (B), and again pull tight. It will be impossible
for any strain upon the leash at C to undo the knot.
And when it is desired to undo it, the end (A) can easily
be picked out with the fingers through the tightened loop
(B), and a simple pull upon A will then undo the whole
fastening.</p>

<p>For attaching hawks to the screen-perch, a sort of double
falconer&rsquo;s knot is required for fastening the two ends of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">« 45 »</a></span>
leash round the pole. But it is learnt with the greatest ease.
Nothing more is necessary than to take the two ends of the
leash&mdash;the thick and the thin&mdash;and pass one over and one
under the pole. Then tie them together, just as if you were
tying a black necktie, except that you make only one bow
instead of two. Let this one bow, when the knot is pulled
tight, be about four inches long; and through the loop formed
by it pass the two ends of the leash, which will naturally be
found on the reverse side of the knot (<a href="#fig_10">Fig. 10</a>). When the
hawk is carried on the fist, the ends of the jesses, the swivel, and
button of the leash will often lie in the palm of the left hand.
The leash will hang down for some inches, perhaps a foot, and
then, forming a loop, be gathered up to the little finger, round
which the lower part, a few inches from the thin end, is wound
for the sake of extra security.</p>

<p>Smaller leashes in the same style, but made of less stout
leather, can very well be used for the smaller hawks, and usually
are so. But when these hawks are doing a great deal of flying,
as they should, and doing it twice a day, the trouble of constantly
unfastening the ring-swivel from the jesses and fastening
it on again becomes very tiresome, and even vexatious; and it
is a common practice to use spring-swivels permanently. The
outer ring of these (unless they are made specially) is too small
to admit the passage of a flat leash; and it will be found more
convenient to use thongs shaped like a porpoise-hide boot-lace.
In fact a long leather boot-lace makes about as good a
leash as can be wished for. The function of the button is
fulfilled by a simple knot tied in the end of the lace. Or in
order to save still more time, the lace may be permanently
attached to the spring-swivel in the manner shown in the
diagram (<a href="#fig_25">Fig. 25</a>). By making the knot an inch or two
away from the ring of the swivel, instead of close up to it,
enough length of tether is left, when the leash is tied round the
pole, to enable a merlin or sparrow-hawk in short &ldquo;racing
jesses&rdquo; to shift about a bit on the perch.</p>

<p>The proper place for a hawk, when not out of doors, is the
screen-perch (<a href="#fig_23">Fig. 23</a>). The bar on which the hawk stands
may run from wall to wall of the hawk-house, or, if this is not
convenient, it may be supported on arms or brackets reaching
out from the wall to a distance of not less than 30 in. for a
big hawk, or 2 ft. for a little one. Where this arrangement is
also impossible the bar may be supported at each end on a post
or tressels so securely fastened or weighted that they cannot be
upset or moved out of place. Round the bar, which should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">« 46 »</a></span>
of wood, is wrapped a padding of baize or other soft stuff, and
over it a covering of canvas stretched very tight. The canvas
may be nailed to the pole, or stitched together, on the under
side. A screen, or curtain, of canvas must be attached to the
under side of the perch, and hang down from it for more than
two feet, to form a sort of ladder, by which any hawk may
climb up again as often as she bates off and hangs by her
leash and swivel. The ends of this screen may be kept down
with weights attached to it, or stretched by a sort of guy ropes
from the lower corners, so as to keep the whole flat and taut. In
perches for small hawks, the same canvas which is rolled round
the pole is often allowed to hang down and form the screen.
In this case slits or holes are made in the canvas just below
the pole, through which the leashes may be passed when
fastening the hawks to the perch. A space of at least
2 ft. should be left between each big hawk and that which
stands next her on the perch; and 18 in. between each
of the small ones; and there should be rather more space
between the end hawk and the wall or the bracket of the
perch, whichever it is.</p>

<p>Underneath the perch must be spread a good thick layer of
sand or sawdust, extending in the case of peregrines and
gers for a good yard on each side of the perch, and about
18 in. in the case of the smaller long-winged hawks, to catch
the mutes. As for short-winged hawks, the layer must be very
much farther extended, and in the case of goshawks should
reach at least three yards from the perch. And if the perch is
near a wall, the wall itself must be protected by a shield of
paper, or other cheap material which can be changed every
other day, for these hawks &ldquo;slice&rdquo; to a very great distance
almost horizontally. The sand or sawdust must either be removed
daily, or at least freed from the mutes which have fallen
into it. In or near it will also be found the &ldquo;castings,&rdquo; or pellets
of refuse feathers and other indigestible matter thrown up by
the hawks. These castings should be looked for every morning
by the falconer, and each one should be examined before it is
thrown away, as it is by the appearance of them, as will be seen
later on, that the state of health of each hawk is to a large
extent ascertained. Both castings and mutes, with the sand or
sawdust adhering to them, should, when collected, be immediately
removed from the hawk-house. A dirty or ill-smelling
room is not only a disgrace to the falconer, but injurious to the
inmates, which, though possessed of no sense of smell, require
the purest possible air to breathe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">« 47 »</a></span></p>

<p>For out-door service, blocks are used for the long-winged
hawks, and bow-perches for the short-winged. Blocks are of
various shapes, as shown in the illustration. The simplest are
made of mere chunks of tree or sapling sawn off level (<a href="#fig_11">Fig. 11</a>),
and having a staple of iron or brass driven into the top or at
the side, to which to attach the leash. They should be from
8 inches to a foot in height for a peregrine or ger, and for all
other hawks of such a height that when the hawk is standing
on them her tail may just clear the tops of the blades of
grass. A high block is not good; for then the leash, if it is
not to catch in the shoulder, must be a long one, and when the
hawk bates she will be brought up with a too sudden jerk as
the leash tightens. For the smaller falcons&mdash;hobbies, merlins,
and kestrels&mdash;as well as for sakers and lanners, the block
should always be larger at the top than at the bottom, so that
it may not be fouled on the sides with the mutes (see Figs. <a href="#fig_12">12</a>,
<a href="#fig_14">14</a>). It is a very good plan to have a groove made round the
body of the block, and to have a metal ring fitted round it, so
that it will run freely in the groove. This hoop of metal may
be looped out into a smaller ring on one side, to which the
leash may be tied (see Figs. <a href="#fig_13">13</a>, <a href="#fig_14">14</a>). As the hawk jumps off to
one side or the other the ring will run round; and thus all
risk is avoided of the leash getting hitched up or wound round
the block. A spike (<a href="#fig_15">Fig. 15</a>) is firmly fixed into the middle of
the base of the block to hold it fast in the ground. Of course a
block which is larger at the base than on the top may be used
without a spike, and without any ring or staple in it, if the
leash is fastened to a ring-peg (<a href="#fig_16">Fig. 16</a>) in the ground. But
even if this peg is driven in on the windward side of the
block, that is, on the side towards which the hawk is pretty
sure to bate off, the risk of entanglement is not wholly avoided;
and a hawk so attached should not be left alone for long.
The top of the block should be covered with cork (<a href="#fig_17">Fig. 17</a>), or
it may be padded and covered with leather. But in the latter
case it must not be left out in the rain. Wood is too hard
for hawks to stand on for any length of time, and is apt to give
them corns or sore feet. No hawk should be allowed to stand
on a wet block. A simple and not a bad plan for making
merlins&rsquo; blocks, is to saw off a chunk from a pole or
tree branch, about 2&#189; in. in diameter and 5 or 6 in. long.
Into one end insert a spike, and on to the other nail
a 4-in. or 5-in. bung (<a href="#fig_18">Fig. 18</a>). A 4-in. metal curtain-ring,
measured from outside to outside, can be placed on
the ground and the spike driven into the earth in the middle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">« 48 »</a></span>
of the ring, which will run freely round the block when the
leash is attached to it. Care must always be taken to drive
the block well home to the ground, or the leash may get
jammed under its lower edge, and cause a dire mishap.
<a href="#fig_19">Fig. 19</a> is a little field block which I use for merlins. It
can be carried in a side-pocket when out on the open downs.
After one of these little hawks has done her day&rsquo;s flying,
or before her turn comes, instead of putting her, hooded, on
the pole cadge, her leash is made fast to the looped creance,
which comes from a ring in the top of the block. The spike is
driven into the ground in a sheltered spot, and the hawk is
deposited on the top of the pigmy post, where she will sit,
if not exactly &ldquo;like patience on a monument,&rdquo; at least more
comfortably than if merely pegged out on the prickly grass or
still more uninviting stubble.</p>

<p>Bow-perches for goshawks and sparrow-hawks may be made
by simply bending a length of yew or other tough wood into
the shape of an arch, and sticking the two sharpened ends into
the ground (<a href="#fig_20">Fig. 20</a>). A more elaborate apparatus made of
iron, with three spikes and a padded top, is shown in <a href="#fig_21">Fig. 21</a>.
In any case it is proper to pad the uppermost part of the arch.
The ring for the leash runs loosely on the outer frame of the
perch. The crutch-like perch shown in <a href="#fig_22">Fig. 22</a> is simple,
and has its merits. Probably for an eagle it is the best
resting-place that could be provided. When fixing up bow-perches
or crutch-perches care should be taken that they are
placed broadside on to the wind, so that the hawk as she
takes perch on them may directly face the wind. It is perhaps
needless to say that for an eagle the spike should be very long,
and hammered deep into the ground.</p>

<p>The hood, or to speak more exactly, the hood proper, is
an article of attire with which every educated person is vaguely
familiar. The exact shape is shown in <a href="#fig_24">Fig. 24</a>. It is made of
stiffish leather, fashioned on a wooden block made of the
size and shape of the hawk for which it is intended, and stitched
together. Some amateurs have arrived at a certain proficiency
in making their own hoods. Captain Salvin, for instance,
could manufacture very good ones. But such excellent hoods
can be obtained from Mr. Möllen, for all sorts of hawks, at
so small a price, that it is scarcely worth while to be at the
trouble of making them. The hooding of hawks is an art
in itself, and will be referred to in a later chapter. When
the hood is well on the hawk&rsquo;s head and the beak well through
the opening in front, the longer and thinner of the braces at
the back (A, A) are pulled apart, and the back of the hood
is thus drawn tight, so that it is impossible to remove it. The
shorter and stouter ends are pulled when it is desired to slacken
the fastening, so that the hood can be taken off by lifting
the plume forwards. Usually each of these operations is
performed with the aid of the right hand and the teeth. As
the hawk stands on the falconer&rsquo;s left fist with her tail outwards
over his knuckles, he takes hold with his right finger
and thumb of the brace which is on the hawk&rsquo;s left side,
and then catches hold with his front teeth of the brace which
is on the hawk&rsquo;s right side. A sharp pull brings the ends
apart, and the hood is braced up or slackened, as the case
may be. Before any hood is ever put on, the falconer should
remember to look inside it to see that no dust or dirt or
stray feathers or anything else has found its way in, and it
is as well to blow a puff of air into it to clear it of any particle
of dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">« 49 »</a></span></p>

<p>The rufter-hood is made of much softer leather, with no
plume, and a simpler fastening. It is used for newly-caught
hawks, and hardly need be described in detail, as before the
beginner has occasion for it he will have learnt more about
hoods than can be taught in any book. Indian hoods are
also made of softer leather, with a different and smaller
plume. They are fastened by braces which run round the
lower side, passing in and out of the leather and working
by friction.</p>

<p>This completes the list of ordinary hawk&rsquo;s furniture. But
there are a few other appliances with which the beginner
must become familiar before he can undertake to train, or even
to keep, a hawk.</p>

<p>A brail (<a href="#fig_28">Fig. 28</a>) is a sort of manacle for an unmanageable
hawk, which keeps on bating and fidgeting with her wings. It
consists of a narrow strip of fine soft leather, having a slit
two or three inches long down the middle. Into this slit
is inserted the pinion joint of the hawk&rsquo;s closed wing. The
upper end of the brail will then of course extend upwards over
her back, and the lower will hang downwards by her side.
Now take the upper end and pass it down under the under
part of her wing between it and her ribs. Pass the lower end
in the contrary direction upwards under the under side of the
same wing. The two ends will now be pointing in the opposite
direction to that first described. Next bring them together
on the outside of the wing, and tie in a plain bow-knot, making
the bows very short and passing the single ends through them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">« 50 »</a></span>
The hawk will be unable to open the wing, which will be to all
intents and purposes as useless to her, as long as the brail is on,
as if all the flight feathers in it had been cut.</p>

<p>A bath must always be offered to a trained hawk at least
twice a week, and oftener in fine and warm weather. And it
is not a thing which can always be improvised very easily.
The best baths are sunk in the ground, so that there are no
upstanding sides round or under which a leash can get entangled.
But of course, unless great care is taken, the ground
round the edges of such a bath is apt to become slushy and
dirty, if much used. Whenever it is impossible to sink the
bath in the earth it is necessary that some person should be at
hand when the hawks are bathing, so that if the leash gets
entangled he may come to the rescue.</p>

<p>Many hawks have a tiresome way of jumping on and off
the sides of the bath, and running round it&mdash;in fact, as
Winchester boys say, &ldquo;funking on the bank&rdquo;&mdash;in complete
oblivion of the fact that they are thereby hitching up their
leashes. For such hawks it is best to take off the leash
and substitute a creance three or four yards long, attaching
the end of this to the block on which they are deposited at
the side of the bath. All baths should be of a sufficient size.
For gers they should be nearly a foot deep at least, and well
over a yard in diameter. For the smallest jack-merlin they
should be not less than four inches deep. A hawk will not
fully enjoy her bath unless she can wade into it, if she chooses,
up to her shoulders and over. In shallow water she is more or
less uncomfortable. Like Alexander the Great, in the small
world of antiquity, <i>æstuat infelix angusto in limite</i>; and her
back and the nape of her neck are never properly wetted,
however much she may splash about in the endeavour to throw
the water over them. The bath should be tilted up, so that it
is shallower at one end than the other, and the bather may
get in, if she chooses, at the shallow end, and wade out as
far as she likes towards the other. According to immemorial
custom a few pebbles should be thrown in to lie on the floor
of the bath. When the weather is very cold, a cup or two of
hot water may be added, to take off the chill; and if the water
used is taken from a deep and cool well it should be allowed
to stand for some time in the sun before being put out for
the hawks. Cemented basins in the ground make, of course,
capital bathing-places. But they are troublesome to keep
clean, and even to empty; and the surrounding edges are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">« 51 »</a></span>
likely to become small quagmires. Perhaps the most serviceable
bath is a common flat bedroom bath, sunk into a cavity
in the ground, and removable at will. A pretty tall block
or for short-winged hawks a bow-perch, should be placed
near the bath, so that the bather, having finished her ablutions
may at once jump on to it.</p>

<p>In some places it is possible to indulge the hawks with a
natural bath. When there is in the neighbourhood a stream
of clean water with a sandy or gravelly bottom and shelving
banks, the hawk may be carried down to a suitable part of
the bank, the block set up, and the creance attached. She
may be left on the block while the falconer retires to a short
distance, and will come back, when bathed, to her post. After
the bath, every hawk should remain out, bareheaded, for about
an hour, in the sun, if possible. She will busy herself first in
spreading her feathers to the sun and wind, and then in
pluming and arranging them&mdash;a work exceedingly agreeable
to those hawks which are particular about their own appearance.</p>

<p>The lure will be more particularly referred to later on. It
may suffice to say here that it is a rough imitation of some bird&mdash;or,
if the hawk is to be trained to ground-game, of some
beast&mdash;used as a bait to which the hawk is taught to come for
food. It is attached to a strong cord or thong a yard or more
long, and sometimes to a swivel. It is the invariable companion
of the falconer in the field, though never allowed to be
seen by the hawk, except when she is required to come to it.
The lure should be a sort of magnet, operating to draw the
hawk towards it as surely as iron will attract a magnetised
needle.</p>

<p>A cadge is a most necessary apparatus when a man is the
possessor of more than one hawk. The orthodox and historic
cadge&mdash;such as one sees in representations of <i>As You Like
It</i> on the stage, or, as once I remember, at a Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
Show&mdash;is a circular or square or oblong frame of wood, three
or four feet across, having straps by which it can be suspended
from the shoulders of a man, who in classic phrase is termed a
&ldquo;cadger,&rdquo; and who stands or walks in the middle, with the
frame surrounding him. At each corner of the frame is a small
jointed leg, which can be hooked up when the cadge is being
carried, and let down when it is to be deposited on the ground.
The bars which form the body of the frame are padded on the
top, and on these stand the hawks, hooded of course, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">« 52 »</a></span>
fastened by their leashes to the frame. The man with the
cadge (whom in these days you will not address by his right
title, unless you wish him to give you a month&rsquo;s notice) will, if
he is a sharp fellow, so carry the cadge that all or most of the
hawks upon it face the wind. On windy days&mdash;and at rook-hawking
time it is mostly pretty windy&mdash;the cadge should
be rested as much as possible under the lee of some shelter,
generally a rick. All hawks very much detest a wind; and
should not be unnecessarily exposed to it. In fact, trained
hawks must be, in this and in all other things, whether at home
or in the field, subjected to as little vexation and annoyance
as can be. Like other creatures, they have tempers of their
own&mdash;sometimes very queer ones; and they have enough to
put up with, as it is, when trained, without any extra trials
that can fairly be spared them. A cadge is shown in the
illustration.</p>

<p>A still greater luxury for the field, especially in rook-hawking,
is the hawk-van, which is a sort of omnibus, fitted
with screen-perches, and hung on very easy springs. In it are
conveyed the hawks which are not for the time being in use,
and also spare lures and other furniture and properties, not
forgetting the luncheon-basket. Such a vehicle will be too
pretentious, as well as too costly, for most private individuals,
but it is used successfully by the Old Hawking Club, whose
excellent arrangements and methods of training and managing
hawks will be repeatedly noticed in these pages.</p>

<p>The box-cadge is a very simple apparatus used for the
transport of hawks by train or other wheeled conveyance. It
is nothing more than a frame resembling the body of a box&mdash;very
often a box itself&mdash;without the lid. The four upper edges
of the sides are padded to form perches. Holes are bored in
the sides an inch or two below, through which the leashes can
be passed and made fast. In the bottom of the box is sawdust
to catch the mutes; and the hawks are put on, as naturally they
would be, facing outwards, with their tails towards the inside of
the box. You will be surprised, if you have never seen it tried,
how small a box will accommodate six or eight great big hawks
sitting in this simple fashion. By the bye, the box-cadge
should be heavily weighted, to prevent upsetting or jolting,
in case any hawk should unluckily bate off.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">CADGE WITH PEREGRINES</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">« 53 »</a></span></p>

<p>The writer of these pages has invented an apparatus which
may be called a pole-cadge, and will attempt to describe it,
because in his own experience he has found it very useful and
handy, especially for small hawks. It consists of a plain pole&mdash;a
broom-handle does very well&mdash;over which a single or
double fold of green baize is stretched and fastened. About
nine inches from each end of the perch thus formed, stout
wire is firmly twisted round it, and the ends of the wire are
allowed to project at an angle of about 90, from one another
downwards. When the perch is being carried, it is simply
grasped by the middle in one hand; and when it is desired
to put it down, the four ends of the wire are rested on the
ground, or pushed into the earth if it is soft enough. The
hawks are, of course, attached by leashes tied round the pole,
as if they were on the screen-perch; and four can be accommodated
with the greatest ease on a short stick&mdash;one near the
bearer&rsquo;s hand on each side of it, and one near each end of the
pole. A long stick would hold six or eight hawks. There is
no reason that I can see why a stouter pole should not be used
for big hawks. The advantage of this over the ordinary and
time-honoured cadge is that all the hawks, if properly placed,
must necessarily face the wind, and need never stand sideways
to it. The pole-cadge can also be picked up and set down
much more quickly. And for carrying hawks when driving in
a dogcart or riding on a bicycle&mdash;a not impossible feat in
these days&mdash;this form of cadge is, I think, unsurpassable.</p>

<p>Hawking-gloves, for wearing when a big hawk is on the fist,
are gauntleted half-way to the elbow, and made of buckskin or
very strong leather. They should, of course, be kept clean and
dry. For the smaller hawks a two-button dogskin glove is
strong enough, and preferable. Some hawks, when they are
very sharp-set, or fidgety and in a bad humour, will pick and tear
at the glove or perch in a tiresome way, and even tear it to
pieces after a while. A cure for this is to rub the exposed part
of the glove or perch with onions or a solution of alum, the
taste of which will generally soon disgust the offender with that
bad habit. Very often, however, it is good to provide such
a hawk with a very tough piece of &ldquo;tiring,&rdquo; such as the
bare pinion of a goose or fowl, upon which to expend her
superfluous energy. Worn gloves should not be patched or
mended, but replaced by fresh ones. A glove which has
once become thoroughly greasy or sodden should be regarded
as spoilt.</p>

<p>Mews, or hawk-houses, are more particularly described in
<a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">Chapter <span class="smcap">XIII</span>.</a> They should be absolutely free from draughts,
and not liable to get too hot in summer or too cold in winter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">« 54 »</a></span>
The doors should fit well, and be kept locked as a rule; and
the windows should all have well-fitting shutters. They should
be ventilated at the top, and be kept bare of furniture and
rubbish of all kinds, and scrupulously clean. The windows
should by preference face towards east and north. And in hot
climates there should be a verandah outside, and double roof
above.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Eyesses and Hack Hawks</span></p>


<p>Eyesses, or young hawks taken from the nest, should
not be taken until the latest possible day. If the captor
can defer the moment until they are able to fly a little, so much
the better. He may then possibly snare them by some means
or another. But this is an exceedingly difficult job, as the
newly-fledged hawk is for a considerable time fed by her
parents, and does not prey for herself. Consequently, she will
not come to any live lure or baited trap, and, being very distrustful
of men, cannot easily even be approached. Thus it is
rarely that even an experienced falconer can lay hands on a
wild hawk after it has once left the eyrie. The next best thing
to be done is to catch the eyesses when they are branchers,
that is to say, when they are able to run and jump about on
the branches of a tree, though not yet able to rise on the wing
from the ground. In short, the longer they can be left in the
natural nursery under the care of their natural guardians, the
better they are likely to turn out, not only in their bodily condition,
but in temper and disposition. Very often, however,
the young birds will come to their trainer when there is a good
deal of the white down of their infancy still clothing their
unwieldy bodies, and only partially replaced by the brown
feathers of their first plumage. At any rate the flight feathers
of the wing will not be nearly down to their full length. The
outer ones will still have some inches to grow; and those of
the tail will be short soft things, with flabby shafts, and not
much shape or strength.</p>

<p>It is for many reasons desirable that the trainer should go
personally to the place where the eyrie is, and either himself
assist in taking the young birds, or at least be ready to receive
them within a few hours, and give them their first feed. Unfortunately,
most hawk-dealers and many gamekeepers have a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">« 56 »</a></span>
rooted objection to this plan, and prefer to muddle about with
the hawks themselves, not sending them off to the purchaser
until they have already unwittingly done them more or less
injury, in one way or another. They either are, or pretend to
be, unable to understand or to believe that an eyess delivered
immediately into the trainer&rsquo;s hand is worth at least 25 per
cent. more to him than one which has been messed about by
unskilled hands, and racketed about in a train for several hours.
This stupid prejudice of the captors and vendors is often productive
of the deplorable blemish called hunger-streaks, which
weakens every important feather in the hawk&rsquo;s body, and to
some extent checks and stunts her whole bodily growth and
energy, just at the time when it is most desirable that they
should be steadily maintained and developed. A hunger-streak
is caused whenever a young hawk has been allowed to grow
unreasonably hungry. The result is that that part of the whole
web and shaft of each feather which is growing out of the body
at the time is deformed through want of proper nourishment,
and bears on it ever afterwards a cross line like a blight, so that
the feather looks as if a sharp razor had been passed lightly
across it. As the feather grows down this line comes down
with it, and may be seen in all its hideousness, after the hawk
is summed, if any big feather is examined carefully. A fast of
more than fifteen hours&mdash;in the daytime&mdash;will generally cause
a slight hunger-streak; but the night hours do not count for
much; so that hawks which have to travel far before getting
into the trainer&rsquo;s hands should be taken late in the day and
started at once, so that they may be met as soon as they arrive
on the following day.</p>

<p>If the falconer cannot attend personally at the capture of
the eyesses, he should at least send to the captor a suitable
hamper in which to pack and send them. This should be
roomy and round in shape, having its sides and top lined inside
with sacking, matting, or other soft material. In the bottom of
it a good thick layer of straw should be lightly strewed, for the
hawks to rest upon; and the lining should fit well enough to
exclude almost all light. Even with all these precautions there
is some risk of breaking feathers, and still more of bending
them and deforming them with dirt. On railways the guards
may generally be cajoled into taking special care that the
hamper is not turned upside down or banged about. But I
have more than once known of valuable hawks arriving dead
from a short sea voyage&mdash;killed by the evident ill-treatment to
which the padded hamper has been subjected on the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">« 57 »</a></span></p>

<p>Once arrived at the trainer&rsquo;s quarters, the hamper should be
opened in a darkened room, with doors and windows closed,
in which has been got ready another straw-lined hamper, this
time of an oblong or square shape. Each hawk in her turn
will be gently taken out of the soiled travelling hamper, of
which the lid can be shut down between the times of removing
the several inmates. Unless these are very young, a rufter-hood
can be slipped on the head of each one, and the jesses
and bell at once attached to her. If they have come far, a
few morsels of food may be given even before the new-comer
has been deposited in the second hamper. But, if too young
to be able to move about much, they can all be transferred
directly to the new quarters, and the lids left open. In every
case the operation of feeding should be at once undertaken.
And a much more troublesome thing this operation is than the
unlearned may suppose. In the first place, there must be in
readiness a good store of fresh, tender beef or sheep&rsquo;s heart,
cut into small strips and slightly warmed. And of this the
new-comers must by some means or other be induced to swallow
at least a small quantity. If care has been taken from the very
first not to alarm them, they may possibly take the morsels
of meat quietly and naturally, when offered to them gently on
the end of a small stick. If so, an important point will have
been gained. But it is much more likely that at the sight of
their new and awful-looking foster-parent&mdash;when a subdued
light has been let into the room&mdash;they will draw back their
heads, open their mouths, and hiss indignantly. Still, if the
meat is very slowly and quietly obtruded towards the open
mouths, there is always a good chance that one of them, bolder
than the rest, will strike at it, half in anger, and half with the
idea that it may be good to eat. And, if such a youngster
should happen at the first shot to catch hold of the piece she
aims at, she is quite likely to swallow it, in which case the rest
of your task becomes easy. If things do not go quite so
smoothly, and a hawk which has seized the meat flips it scornfully
away, there is no need to give up the attempt. She
may do this a dozen times, and at the thirteenth time of asking
may swallow the food and begin feeding readily. Or,
whilst pupil number one is thus making a fool of the teacher,
number two may take heart and come up to the attack, with a
more practical result. Even at the expense of much time and
patience, it is worth while to get the youngsters to conform
from the first, and take their rations willingly and amicably.
As soon as one has done this the others will follow suit, some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">« 58 »</a></span>
quickly and others grudgingly. If all such efforts fail, or if
the hawks, being nearly grown up, bate and begin to dash
about, you must, of course, use rougher measures. To starve
them is worst of all. There is no harm, if all modes of persuasion
fail, in &ldquo;stuffing&rdquo; a young hawk. Let her be held
firmly, and as she opens her mouth in defiance at the meat
offered, let the falconer push it inside her beak, and then, if she
will not swallow it, push it down with the small stick into
her throat. I have known an eyess hobby which had to be
&ldquo;stuffed&rdquo; with all her meals for eight days! And afterwards
she became a fine hawk and a very strong flier.</p>

<p>When all the hawks have taken a half-crop or so, they should
be left in peace in the darkened room for two hours at least.
It is a good thing, by the way, to put on each of them different-coloured
jesses, so that from the first they may be easily known
apart. Brown, yellow, white, orange, and black are perhaps the
best colours&mdash;not red, or pink, or green. Notes may also be
made from the first in a hawk-book or falconer&rsquo;s diary. As, for
instance, &ldquo;June 10&mdash;Eyess peregrines arrived; No. 1: small falcon;
fed readily, and had nearly a full crop; seems strong and
active; outer wing feather about half down; brown jesses and
hack bell. No. 2: big tiercel or small falcon (uncertain); fed
with difficulty; half a crop; seems timid and rather dull; black
jesses.&rdquo; Of course, if the hawks are to be turned out as soon
as they can fly, no slits will be made in the outer end of the
jesses. Another thing which may very probably have to be
done is to clean the hawk&rsquo;s tail-feathers, and possibly the tips
of the wings, if soiled during the journey. This is done with
warm water, soap, and an old toothbrush. If the dirt is allowed
to get hard on the feathers it will be almost impossible to get it
off without fraying the web. The feet of each hawk should also
be well washed and brushed with soap and warm water; and it
is always as well to do the same with the nares, or else brush
them and the beak with a brush dipped in a solution of tobacco.
A fresh feed should be given at intervals of not more than five
hours between sunrise and sunset, <i>i.e.</i> three at least in the day.
In fact, young nestlings can hardly be fed too often or too much,
when they seem ready to eat. But the food should not often be
as heavy as beef. Young pigeons, young chickens, bullock&rsquo;s heart,
and rabbits may be given to the big hawks; small birds&mdash;fresh-killed
always&mdash;and sheep&rsquo;s heart to the small ones. Old pigeons
are rather too heating, and old fowls are too tough. Whenever
butcher&rsquo;s meat is given, it should be slightly warmed first, but not
dipped in water. The hawks must be kept quite dry, and in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">« 59 »</a></span>
moderately warm but airy place, away from all draughts. Very
young sparrow-hawks must be kept in a specially warm and well-sheltered
place, or they are pretty sure to develop a fatal attack
of cramp. Whenever it may be necessary to move a young
hawk or meddle with her, the room should be made as nearly
dark as possible.</p>

<p>After a few feeds, administered quietly and patiently, the
young hawks will begin to lose their distrust of their new surroundings;
and first one and then the others will begin to take
their meat eagerly, stretching their necks out, and perhaps
pushing their way towards the feeder&rsquo;s hand. When this is the
case they may be indulged with a few tit-bits on the fist or on
the lure. If the lure is used, the pieces of meat should be
merely laid upon it, so that at first the hawk may pick them off
quite easily; and by degrees they may be made to walk towards
it from their artificial nest along a causeway roughly constructed
for that purpose. If it is preferred to get them to feed on the
fist, as it probably will in the case of short-winged hawks, they
must first be made to pick pieces off the gloved hand. Then
hold in the gloved fist, between the outer part of the thumb
and the end of the forefinger, a very tender piece of meat or wing
of a small bird. As the hawk takes hold of it, and finds that it
cannot be taken up without a pull, she will, at once or after a
while, give a tug at it, and afterwards probably put out a foot and
seize the glove, using her foot as a leverage, just as an oarsman
uses his stretcher. A little encouragement will make this easy
for her; and by a little management it can be so arranged that
she gets both feet upon the fist. Thus by degrees she will be
induced to stand on the back of the hand, and in that position
tear up her food. The next step is to raise her slowly
up on the fist, while busy at her meal. In like manner, when
pulling at the lure, she may be lifted bodily on it, and thence
shifted adroitly on to the fist, while the garnished part of the
lure is still kept under her.</p>

<p>With a little luck this stage of the young bird&rsquo;s education
may have been reached at almost the same time when the
feathers are nearly down and they are ready to fly. In such
case the sooner they are turned out to hack the better. When
they have grown so accustomed to feeding on the lure or on
hand that they will run to it as soon as they see it, they may be
let loose in the hack field, with a man to watch them, having a
lure with him to entice them if they stray away. Most of the
popular books dealing with hawking complacently assume that
here no difficulty arises. Unfortunately for the beginner, such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">« 60 »</a></span>
difficulties will occur, even in the best-regulated establishments.
For instance, the hawks may begin to fly the very day after they
arrive, and before they will feed willingly. What is to be done
in such a case? Well, each hawk must be made to the lure or
the fist before she is turned out. She may be brailed and kept
in a spare room, with or without her sisters and brothers. Or
she may have slits cut in her jesses, and be attached by a leash
to a block, for all the world like a trained hawk, and thence
enticed by degrees to run to the lure for her food, until she is
keen for it. She should at least know what the lure means before
being let entirely loose. But it is generally sufficient that one
of a lot which came from the same nest should be made to the
lure. The rest, when turned out, will find their way, when
hungry, after her to the feeding-place. Some special caution
should be observed with hobbies. I know of two which would
come to the lure in an outhouse, but only reluctantly. They
were turned out one morning to hack in a quiet place, and,
though they had never flown more than a yard high before,
went up into tall fir-trees. And there they remained, staring
at the well-garnished lures which were laid out underneath,
declining to go down, taking short flights from tree to tree, and
cruising about in the air. This state of affairs continued for about
three days, after which it was discovered that the two youngsters&mdash;who
had never been seen to chase anything, far less to kill
it&mdash;had become wild hawks! Some falconers habitually carry
their eyesses, break them to the hood, and partially reclaim
them, before turning them out to hack. But the more natural
and promising system is never to confine them at all until they
are taken up at the end of the period of hack. The youngster,
when thus treated, has become, by the time she has to be put
in training, as like a wild hawk as a tame one can be. And, as
the haggard is better than the red passager, and the passager
than the soar-hawk, so by analogy it may be assumed as a rule
that the hack hawk which has never been handled is superior
to the eyess which has. Sir John Sebright&rsquo;s plan of putting
out the young hawks in a hamper hung against a tree-trunk,
with the lid of the hamper turned down as a platform by day,
and fastened up at night, will answer with orderly, well-behaved
hawks. But it will be wise to keep a close watch upon the
artificial nest, in case of a hawk jumping off when it can run
but cannot fly. It might stray for ever so far, and hide in
bushes, or be devoured by a cat or fox.</p>

<p>We suppose now that the eyesses are at hack. Even yet
their outer wing feathers will not be fully down; and the sails,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">« 61 »</a></span>
even of those which will ultimately be the longest winged,
appear rounded at the ends, like those of a sparrow-hawk. But
they will very soon learn to fly quite well, with a rather gliding
movement, the tips of the feathers bending upwards as they strike
the air. They will not go far from the spot where they are
turned out. What sort of place should this be that is chosen
for the hack ground? That depends upon the facilities which
the trainer enjoys for selecting a country. None perhaps is
better than a large park, with fir-trees in it, or an open moor
with a few stone walls. If the falconer is nervous about turning
out a whole nestful at once, he may tether one of the most
backward at a block in the middle of the hack field, with a
&ldquo;tiring&rdquo; to amuse her, and place some garnished lures on the
ground near to her, to which the liberated hawks may come
when they like. There should also be spare blocks put out in
the field, upon which the hack hawks may jump if they like
after feeding. Of course, if the weather is very wet, the commencement
of hack should be deferred till it is more settled,
and the hawks brailed and let loose in an empty room or loft.
If they have been &ldquo;manned&rdquo; pretty well before they are turned
out, and will allow themselves to be taken up when feeding on the
lure, they may be taken in under shelter the first night or two.
But if it is fairly warm and fine they will be better left out.
They will generally at or soon after sunset go up into pretty
tall trees to roost. If they stay too long on a block or a gate
or post, it is as well to drive or take them off, and see that they
are perched up somewhere aloft, out of harm&rsquo;s way. By the
bye, hawks, as a rule, should be turned loose in the early part
of the day, after a light feed, so that they may be sure to get
hungry again by the middle of the day. Jubilee, the best hack
hawk I ever had, when he was let loose at 7 a.m., having never
before flown two yards, spread his wings, and at the first start
flew softly but steadily away across a small river, and, rising
easily, took perch 300 yards off on the top branches of an elm
70 feet high. He afterwards flitted about from one high tree
to another within a range of 500 yards, and only at midday came
down to his sister, who was eating her luncheon at a block in
the hack field. He spent that night in a tall elm, not far off, and
did not go more than half a mile from the hack field until he
was taken up nearly a fortnight later.</p>

<p>If the falconer can hack his own hawks, so much the better.
He will learn during the process much about their individual
characters and aptitudes. Often he will name them in accordance
with their peculiarities or the adventures which each may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">« 62 »</a></span>
meet with. It is, however, generally possible for him to get his
hawks hacked by some other person, or to purchase fully-hacked
hawks after they have been taken up. The worst of it is that
unless you know a good deal about the deputy hawk-master,
you have no guarantee that the month&rsquo;s hack which they are
supposed to have had is real or imaginary.</p>

<p>On the first or second day of hack the falconer should make
up his mind whether he will hack his hawks to the lure, to the
fist, or to the board. For short-winged hawks the fist or the
board is preferable. For gers, peregrines, and hobbies, the board
or the lure. For merlins, the lure and the fist, combined in such
proportions as seems to be most suitable; generally more of the
lure than of the fist. Each of the systems has its merits, and
each its defects.</p>

<p>If the board is chosen, it must be substituted at once for the
lure which was used on the first day. It consists of a plank or
log of wood, the lower side of which rests on the ground, while
to the top side is attached the food for the expected guests.
One ration should be provided for each hawk out&mdash;at intervals of
two feet or so all along the board. It is very important that
the meat should be so attached that it cannot be pulled off and
carried away, but must be, strictly speaking, consumed on the premises.
When the feast consists of rabbits&rsquo; legs, fowls&rsquo; wings, or the
like, it can be firmly tied by the bone. But, when meat is given,
much care and ingenuity is required to make it fast. Perhaps the
best plan is to tie the piece tightly by the two opposite corners.
If it is possible for a hawk to bolt with a substantial piece, she
is quite likely to do so. And, having done so once, she will try
to do it again, especially if she happens to be a shy hawk, and
afraid of her stronger sisters who are beside her at the board.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that hawks at hack exhibit a good deal of
perversity in their dealings with the hack board. Theoretically,
each of them ought to come down punctually at meal-time, and
take her place at the <i>al fresco</i> table, where she can eat up in
peace and quiet the portion set out for her, without interference
by or with her neighbours. But, as a matter of fact, I regret to
say that, instead of adopting this rational and orderly course,
hack hawks are often no better behaved than an American
traveller at a roadside feeding-place, or a dowager at a ball-supper.
As soon as the first comer has settled down to that part of the
board to which chance or choice has brought her, the next comer
will make straight for the same spot, taking no notice whatever of
the dainty morsels with which the rest of the board is bedecked.
Thereupon, of course, squabblings and bickerings, and probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">« 63 »</a></span>
a scuffle, in which the weaker or less greedy of the rival gluttons
is driven off. Sometimes there will be three hungry young ladies
at the same piece, and a sort of battle ensues. Fortunately the
quarrel does not end in blows, nor in broken feathers, unless the
edges of the board have carelessly been left square and sharp
at the upper edges. The disadvantages of the board-school
system, as it may be called, are thus considerable. It leads to
rivalries and jealousies, and sometimes to free fights, among the
school-children. These are not birds which, in the words of Dr.
Watts, &ldquo;in their little nests agree.&rdquo; Moreover, one bad habit
at least is very likely to be learnt. It is impossible always to
fix on the rations to the board so that they cannot be pulled off
until finished. Suppose, now, that a tiercel, having eaten half
his ration, finds that the remainder has come loose. And
suppose that one of his sisters, having made a joint meal farther
down the board with another falcon, happens to want some more.
She may turn a covetous eye towards the tiercel&rsquo;s portion.
Upon which exit the latter, food in hand, closely followed by
his big sister, who gives him a hot time of it, chasing him about
the hack field, and probably catching him. Then follows a
tooth-and-nail encounter, in which the male, or unworthier sex,
as it is with hawks, gets the worst of it. Few things can be
more conducive than this to the tiresome vice of carrying. It
is for this reason that, in the case of merlins, which are especially
addicted to this fault, I do not much believe in the board system.
On the other hand, it has its advocates and its advantages.
Hawks which are so hacked soon become much wilder than
when treated in another way. And wildness, at this period of a
hawk&rsquo;s life, is a thing to be desired. Board-school hawks, when
taken up, are found to more nearly resemble a wild-caught bird.
They seldom or never scream. They have none of the namby-pamby,
molly-coddle habits of the fist-fed or lure-fed eyess.
They do not hang about round the trainer, or follow him like
spaniels. On the contrary, they often will not come down to
the board unless he retires to a respectful distance. They are
unapproachable by any louts or strollers who may come in sight,
and, being shy, take wing very readily, and generally get more
flying, and at a better pace.</p>

<p>If the lure system is chosen, the trainer goes to the hack
field at feeding-times with as many lures as there are hawks at
hack. Each lure must be so heavy that the hawk cannot move
it at all, and the food must be attached so that it cannot be
pulled off while uneaten. To the first hawk which comes up
the first lure will be thrown out; to the second comer another;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">« 64 »</a></span>
and so on till the last is served. Fighting will occur, no doubt,
as it is impossible to prevent two hawks from coming down to
one lure. But, then, the master of the ceremonies is at hand to
separate the combatants, and keep each to her own lure, whereas
at the board they have to just fight it out.</p>

<p>It is much the same thing with the fist-feeding system. But
this can hardly be attempted with success when many big hawks
are at hack together. As the trainer comes to the hack field,
the hack hawks will come up, taking perch on his hand, his
head, his shoulder, or wherever they can find a place. Two or
three may generally be accommodated on the left forearm and
fist. From his meat-box or feeding-pouch the trainer will take
out with his right hand the prepared mouthfuls of food, and
distribute them impartially among the hungry claimants. But
if there is more than one hawk out, it will be found almost
necessary, and certainly convenient, to use lures as well. After
a few morsels have been distributed, these lures can be thrown
down for all the hawks except one, which may finish her meal on
the fist. One day one hawk may thus be retained, and another
day another may take her turn, so that all keep up their habit
of feeding freely there. Sparrow-hawks which are to be hacked
on this system may be coped a little before they are turned out,
for they have a way of digging in their claws to any soft place.
But a goshawk can only be hacked to the fist if she or he is the
only one out. The spectacle of a falconer (or ostringer, to use the
correct word) with a goshawk&rsquo;s claws firmly fixed in his head
or shoulder would be a rare subject for a serio-comic portrait!</p>

<p>Meal-times for the hack hawks should be pretty punctually
observed. Otherwise the hawks will become irregular in their
habits, and the falconer will be compelled rather to dance
attendance on them than they on him. The food may be left
out on the board for an hour each time, and then removed,
before it has become fly-blown or soaked with rain or frizzled
in the sun. 6 to 7 a.m., noon to 1, and 6 to 7 p.m., are very
good hours. And each time when the board is garnished and
the food in readiness, the trainer may blow a whistle, or ring a
bell, or sound a gong, to give notice from afar. At each meal
there must be &ldquo;calling over&rdquo;; and if there is any absentee a
mark must be recorded against his or her name.</p>

<p>A bath or two must be set out in the hack field. From about
9 to 11 a.m. it should be kept pretty full of clean fresh water;
but it should be removed or emptied before noon. Most hawks
are very capricious about bathing; and hobbies, which want it
most, will seldom bathe at all. The others should be accustomed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">« 65 »</a></span>
to bathe early in the day, so that when they are old they
will not depart from this godly habit. Plenty of blocks should
stand around, on which the bathed hawks may stand to sun and
air themselves.</p>

<p>The longer the period of hack can be safely protracted the
better for the hack hawk and her trainer. All the while she is
learning to fly. During the latter part she is also learning to
chase and to stoop. Here it is that the danger comes in.
For in that ardour of youthful chase what kills may come!
At first the random shots made from tall tree-tops at passing
swallows will be wide enough of the mark. Even the young
missel-thrushes or wood-pigeons which have frequented the
hack ground will make light of the clumsy efforts made to
cut them down; and the house-pigeons from the nearest dovecot
will treat with supreme contempt the well-meaning but
awkward stoops made at them. But every day finds the
young hawks more expert, as well as stronger on the wing.
The long feathers are now all down. The shafts harden, and
no longer bend perceptibly as the wing-tips strike the air.
Presently the flights at wild birds are no longer mere child&rsquo;s
play. The fugitives have to exert themselves to save their
skins. Very likely the young hunters of the air are not at first
altogether in earnest. Secure of their food at the hack board
or lure or fist, and trusting to it for their subsistence, they are
merely &ldquo;having a lark&rdquo; with the intruders on what has begun
to be their domain. But it is increasingly difficult to know how
much of their endeavours is play and how much real business.
Be sure, however, that when any stoop, whether playful or not,
proves successful, and the unfortunate victim is in the pursuer&rsquo;s
clutch, there will be no more play; and on some lonely patch
of ground not fifty miles from the hack field there will be left
a litter of feathers, the mortal remains of the first quarry killed
by hawks of the year.</p>

<p>Let me here quote from my hawk diary: &ldquo;12 noon; out
to hack field, and follow a blackbird down Butt&rsquo;s orchard hedge.
Nearing the corner, blackbird (young cock) takes across the
orchard. Drop him, winged, as he goes over the front hedge;
and he falls in the hack field. Jubilee [eyess male merlin] is
on a block in the middle of it, 90 yards off. It is his third
day out. As the blackbird falls, he starts, and, stooping at it
as it runs, takes it, kills it, and begins to plume it like a wild
hawk before I get up.&rdquo; Pretty sharp work this for a little
hawk that had never used his wings till the day before yesterday.
But this capture of a winged bird was not counted as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">« 66 »</a></span>
&ldquo;kill&rdquo;; and Jubilee was left out for a good eight days more,
and might probably have been left a few longer. Hack hawks
know no sentimental scruples about taking their prey on the
ground. Here is another extract from a hawk diary: &ldquo;6.30
a.m., out and fed hack hawks on lure. &lsquo;She&rsquo; not visible. At
7 saw her on wire fence, half-way across park. As I got near
with lure she started, and, flying low over the ground away
from me, turned suddenly, and dropped on some bird in the
grass. Was pluming it, when heifers came right up to her.
Then lifted, and carried into the lower belt. Quarry looked
like a missel-thrush.&rdquo; The same day &ldquo;She&rdquo; was taken up. It
is a risky thing to leave hawks out after they have once begun
serious and successful chasing. Yet it is a thousand pities to
take them up too soon, just when they are improving most
rapidly. Peregrines may be left out, with heavy hack-bells, for
four weeks or occasionally more. Merlins seldom more than
three weeks. If the hack place and its neighbourhood are very
open, and the wild birds about are few, there is less danger, and
less need for hurry. But when the trees and bushes are well
stocked with wood-pigeons, thrushes, and small birds, beware.</p>

<p>It is now that the advantage will be seen of putting distinctive
jesses on the hawks. The trainer must watch the board
carefully. He may not be able to get within 80 yards of it.
But from his hiding-place, be it far or near, he must tell over the
number of his charges every morning, noon, and evening, so as
to see that all have been down. A field-glass may be necessary
to identify each visitant. Brown-jess may come down at 6 a.m.,
take a light breakfast, and be off. White-jess may not appear
till 12; and even then no signs of Black-jess. The case
begins to look serious. But at 12.50 at last a hawk comes
down. Is this the truant? Or is it Brown-jess again, with her
luncheon appetite come on? The glass will tell you quickly
if the colour of the jesses worn corresponds to the one name
or the other. But if both hawks wore the same coloured jesses,
you could not say. If the last comer is Black-jess&mdash;only delayed
till so late by mere want of appetite&mdash;she may be left out,
perhaps for some days longer. And the extra days&rsquo; exercise
will undoubtedly make her a faster and stronger hawk. But if
you cannot tell one hawk from another, it will be impossible for
you to know when one has missed two successive meals or not.
If Black-jess absents herself all day until the evening repast,
the inference is strong that in the morning she killed something
for herself. If she keeps away for a whole day, that conclusion
becomes almost a certainty. She must be taken up when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">« 67 »</a></span>
first chance occurs. Here, however, arises a fresh difficulty. If
it is a tiercel who so absents himself&mdash;especially a small tiercel&mdash;the
presumption that he has killed for himself is pretty well
conclusive. But what if it is a falcon? Her brother may have
chased and killed; and the sister&mdash;a slow hawk who could not
catch anything for herself&mdash;may have seen the flight, or seen
the tiercel pluming his dead quarry, and then come up, and
by her superior strength driven him off, and pirated the spoil.
You, wrongly inferring that it was she who killed the quarry,
will take her up the next day, quite prematurely, and leave the
real captor, who is much more worthy of bonds and imprisonment,
to remain in dangerous liberty. The same doubt may
arise when the absentee is an extra strong and extra greedy
bird of either sex. That she or he has breakfasted or dined out
is, of course, equally clear. But was it the captive of her own
wings and talons that she devoured, or that of a weaker, but
cleverer, hawk? These are questions impossible to answer,
unless some person has actually seen what occurred. The
safest plan, though not the most magnanimous, when such
evidence cannot be got, is, when one hawk has clearly been
killing, to take the whole lot up.</p>

<p>Hack hawks are as various in their habits at hack as they
are at all other times. Some are lazy, some active, some both
by fits and starts. One will be playful, and find a childish
delight in chasing butterflies or falling leaves. Others, surly
and ill-tempered, ready on slight provocation to make vicious
stoops at their brethren or sisters. Some will sit for hours
sullenly on a post; others will fly long distances for their own
amusement, and soar aloft to a good height. These are the
most promising. The falconer, if he keeps his eyes open, will
have learnt before hack is over pretty well the relative speeds
and particular dispositions of his wards. Rarely are these early
indications falsified in after-life. But a backward hawk is not
necessarily a bad hawk. During quite the last days of hack a
hawk which had seemed rather dull and slow will sometimes
wake up, and put on pace in an astonishing way, until from
being a member of the awkward squad she comes to rival the
leaders of the whole school in activity and speed. But a sulky
and moping hawk seldom turns out first-rate.</p>

<p>Speed is the great desideratum in a hawk. It is like the
&ldquo;big battalions&rdquo; in an army; like a good eye to a cricketer.
When people complain about bad-tempered hawks, it is often
the trainer who is to blame. But in the matter of speed, as
shown at hack time, the trainer is hardly, if at all, responsible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">« 68 »</a></span>
Bad temper is a nuisance, no doubt, and a difficulty. But want
of speed is worse. It is incurably destructive of good sport.
And here, speaking of the relative speeds of hawks at hack, I
will ask leave to relate two anecdotes. Queen, a powerful and
speedy, but not very brilliant flier, went off with a rabbit&rsquo;s head,
pursued by her sister and two brothers. Winding about along
the side of a long hedge, now one side and now the other, she
evaded all their stoops, and, after reaching the end of the hedge,
where there were some elms and oaks, dodged rapidly in and out
among them, loaded as she was, throwing out all the pursuers,
and finally conveying her booty to a safe corner, where she
discussed it all by herself in peace.</p>

<p>On his eleventh day of hack, Jubilee, the male merlin already
referred to, was sitting with his two sisters and one brother in
the branches of a fallen tree in the hack field, under which I
was seated, garnishing the lures for their delectation a little later
on. Suddenly the little hawk started at his best pace right
down the field. I supposed that he was after some blackbird
in the far hedge. But before reaching it he turned, and began
mounting as he came back towards me. I looked round, and for
the first time saw that a wild kestrel had come over into the
field, and was dodging the stoops made at him by the remaining
merlins. Now this kestrel was one of a brood which had
been flying at hack under their parents&rsquo; care in a neighbouring
field. They were already strong on the wing before the merlins
were turned out; and I had been rather fearing, when I discovered
their near presence, that they might do the young
merlins a bad turn. No encounter had, however, as yet occurred
between the two families. The kestrel had at first little difficulty
in eluding the stoops of the three merlins, who seemed
not much in earnest. But when Jubilee came over, at some
height in the air, there was a different tale to tell. With his first
stoop he made the wild hawk cry out; at the second he almost
feathered him, and made him shuffle off to the orchard near
at hand, where, swirling round the tree-trunks, he threw out
his assailant, and made off to a tall elm. Here, no doubt, he
fancied he was safe, especially as the other hawks, on Jubilee&rsquo;s
appearance, tailed off. But not a bit of it. Throwing himself
well up above the elm, the little jack dashed down at the enemy
in the tree, dislodged him, and with a back-handed stoop drove
him down to the ground, hunted him all across a meadow,
grazing him at every shot he made, and lost him in a big
orchard farther on. The pace of the wild hawk was very poor
in comparison with that of this half-tame lure-hacked merlin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">« 69 »</a></span>
It seemed as if the latter could have given him ten yards in a
hundred. In straight-ahead flying, in mounting, and in throwing
up, the kestrel was completely outpaced. Yet before now
trained merlins, as I have heard tell, have been outflown and
chased by a wild kestrel. I should not like, and do not ever
expect, to own such a trained merlin.</p>

<p>The day comes&mdash;all too soon&mdash;when the falconer dares to
keep the hack hawks out no longer. The decree goes out for
one to be taken up. If this one has been hacked to the fist
the proceeding is simple enough. As she stands complacently
breakfasting on the fist, the jesses are grasped in the fingers of
the left hand. A couple of snips with a sharp pair of strong
nail-scissors make a slit in the two jesses. And through these
a spring swivel is deftly slipped. Attached to the swivel is a
leash, the end of which is wound round the little finger, while
the button of it is grasped in the palm of the left hand. As the
hawk proceeds with her meal she is taken quietly to a darkened
room, where a rufter hood is slipped on her head. Five minutes'
carrying, and she is placed on a mound of turf, food and all,
while the leash, unwound from the little finger, is fastened to a
peg strongly planted in the ground. If the hawk has been
hacked to the lure or to the board, the process is a little more
complicated, but presents no real difficulty. A bow-net must
then be used. This instrument is more fully described in the
next chapter. It consists of a hoop of metal on which a light
net is stitched. The ends are fixed down; and the hoop is
so set that a pull on a long string will bring the rim up and
over any object which may be near it on the near side. The
object, of course, in this case will be the lure, or the piece of
food with which the hack board is garnished. When the hawk
is feeding, the string is pulled. The net swings over, encompassing
both meat and hawk. Up runs the falconer, to secure
the captive, who is made fast, hooded, and taken home.</p>

<p>Even if a hawk has begun to prey for herself, she can still
often be captured with a live lure, that is, a live bird attached
to a light cord. Once find the hawk, and let the live lure fly,
and she is pretty sure to take it. Then she may be snared in
one of the ways described in the chapter on Lost Hawks.</p>

<p>A hack hawk, once taken up, is treated in very much the
same way as a wild-caught hawk. The process of reclamation
begins at once. And this process will be found described at
length in the succeeding chapter.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Passage Hawks</span></p>


<p>All big hawks captured after they have begun to prey
for themselves are now commonly called passage hawks,
although the name, strictly speaking, may not be at all correct.
Wild-caught is a more inclusive term; and it is often used in
the case of sparrow-hawks, merlins, and hobbies, when casually
caught by bird-catchers or gamekeepers, and not killed in the
process. We have seen that passage hawk means properly a
hawk caught during the period of her first migration southwards.
It is, however, of course, possible to capture her either
in early autumn before the migration has commenced&mdash;in which
case a peregrine is more properly called a slight falcon or
slight tiercel&mdash;or late in the winter, when she has become a
lantiner, or in the spring migration, when she is travelling
north. But if she has begun to moult before she comes into
man&rsquo;s possession, she is correctly described as a haggard. If
gamekeepers were a little more alive to their own interests they
would often catch sparrow-hawks, and sometimes merlins and
peregrines, alive, and dispose of them at a very remunerative
price, instead of killing them, often in a most barbarous way, by
means of pole-traps and other snares, which destroy or cripple
them after hours of torture, and render them almost valueless.
But for generations past no systematic attempts have been
made in this country to snare wild hawks in an uninjured
condition; and if a falconer should be able to obtain any hawk
so taken he may consider himself exceptionally lucky. Several
such hawks have indeed been caught in England, and, getting
rather accidentally into good hands, have turned out very
excellent performers. Occasionally a sparrow-hawk or merlin is
saved alive out of the nets of a bird-catcher; and these, if heard
of before their plumage is ruined, are prizes for which many
a falconer will gladly give something like their weight in silver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">« 71 »</a></span></p>

<p>But, as a rule, the full-grown hawks which come into the
market are captives which have been taken on the autumnal
passage by the professional hawk-catchers of Valkenswaard, in
North Brabant. The sons of Adrian Möllen, formerly falconer
to the famous Loo Club, still carry on this business of snaring
peregrines on the great open heath, which for many centuries
has been resorted to for a like purpose, and which, of course,
takes its name from its renown as a place over which the
migrants must often pass. Anyone who wants a wild-caught
peregrine should write beforehand to one of these gentlemen,
who will probably not fail to send him what he requires. They
go out every year, in the months of October and November,
and lie in wait daily in their cunningly-constructed huts until
they have secured as many captives as have been ordered in
various places. A dozen or more are annually required for
England, and sometimes a few for France. The variety most
in demand is the red falcon, that is to say, the female peregrine
in the nestling plumage, not yet moulted. But blue falcons are
also sometimes wanted, and of late years there has been some
considerable demand for tiercels, both red and blue. Merlins,
sparrow-hawks, and an occasional goshawk may be taken,
and, still more rarely, a ger. The price for a falcon is four to
five pounds, and of a tiercel from three to four. But a special
apparatus is required for catching the smaller hawks, which will
not usually come to the same lure as a peregrine. If the
captured hawk has to be kept for any length of time in the
captor&rsquo;s hands before being fetched or sent away, an extra
charge is made for her maintenance.</p>

<p>The device whereby the wild hawk is caught in Holland is
somewhat elaborate. It has more than once been described in
print, and may be briefly noticed here. A hut is first built up
with sods of turf in an open part of the plain. It looks from
outside like a mere knoll or rising in the ground. A nearer
inspection shows a small opening in front, through which a
man, or at a pinch two men, can crawl. It is fitted with a low
seat inside, and at the back, behind and above the seat, is an
aperture something like the small port-hole of a cabin, which
can be opened by pulling out a sod of turf, and closed by
replacing the same. This is to enable the hawk-catcher to spy
out at a hawk which is coming up from behind his back.
Outside the hut and in front of it is a sort of small altar or
table of turf, on the flat top of which is pegged down, by means
of a short creance and jesses, a butcher-bird or shrike. Scraps
of meat are set out for the delectation of this feathered watchman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">« 72 »</a></span>
who is also indulged with a miniature hut of his own, into
which he may retreat when terrified, as it is hoped that he soon
may be. The eyesight of this tethered spy is so keen that he
can descry his enemy the hawk at an incredible distance in the
sky. Whenever one is approaching, though far out of range of
the sharpest human eye, he begins to exhibit signs of alarm.
As the hawk comes nearer he fidgets more and more, glancing
nervously&mdash;or pointing, as they call it&mdash;in the direction of the
foe. If the latter still comes nearer, he will cry out in his
terror, and finally run cowering under the shelter of his hut.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the falconer has not been idle. Snatching the
turf shutter from the little window behind him, he takes a look
through his field-glass in the direction to which the shrike is
pointing, searching for the coming hawk as an astronomer does
for a lost star. If, on espying it, he judges that it is a peregrine,
he sets to work seriously about the main business of the day.</p>

<p>At some distance from the hut is fixed up a pole with a
line&mdash;we will call it A&mdash;running from the top of it to the hut.
To this line, at some yards distance from the pole, is attached
a branch line, after the manner of the paternoster used in
angling, at the end of which is a live pigeon in jesses. When
the line A is slack, the pigeon rests on the ground, or in a hut
to which he is at liberty to resort when he likes. But if, by a
pull in the falconer&rsquo;s hut, the line A is pulled taut, up goes the
pigeon in the air, and flutters about at the end of his branch
line, conspicuous from afar. Often there is a second pole at
a like distance from the big hut, but in a rather different
direction; and to this a second line, B, is attached, with a tame
tiercel or peregrine of some sort, rigged out in the same way as
the pole-pigeon. This hawk may have a handful of straw or
worsted fastened to one of his feet, so that he may look as if he
had some dead quarry in possession, and serve the better to
attract the wild passager. As the shrike points, and the wild
hawk is coming up, the falconer works with a will by the two
strings A and B at the pole-hawk and the pole-pigeon. But
as soon as the passager is nearly overhead, and the shrike has
hidden himself, it is time to let loose the pole strings and let
the very live lures attached to it also bolt into shelter.</p>

<p>We now come to another component part of the Dutch
hawk-trap. A third line, C, leads from the hut to a small ring-peg
in the ground sixty or eighty yards away, passes through
it, and a few feet farther on, but at the side, is attached to a
live pigeon in a box, out of which it can be pulled by drawing
the line. One more particular, and the whole apparatus is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">« 73 »</a></span>
complete. On each side of the ring-peg, and about two feet
from it, are pegs which hold down the hinges of a bow-net,
something like that which was used for catching up the hack
hawks. The usual and best way of making a bow-net is to
take two equal lengths of strong wire, five or six feet long, and
bend each into a nearly semicircular arch. The two ends of
each hoop are twisted up into a ring, and the two hoops are
joined together so that a sort of easy hinge is formed at the
ends. A net of fine but strong string is stretched over the
whole circle formed by the two hoops. When it is set, one-half
of it is pegged down flat on the ground and the other is folded
back over it. To the middle of the upper hoop is attached a
fourth long line, D, by which it can be pulled over, so that when
the line is taut the hoops form a circle, with the net covering
all the space between the hinges. This will explain how the
falconer, ensconced in his hut, can, by a pull at the long line
D, passing through a ground peg to the arch of the bow-net,
pull it over the ring through which the line C passes. Thus
there are four lines of which the ends lie in the floor of the hut,
each marked with a different colour, and each requiring to be
worked with prompt and accurate skill at the eventful moment.</p>

<p>We can now understand the whole process of entrapping
the passage hawk, and shall find that it includes the following
movements:&mdash;(1) Pointing of the shrike; (2) removal of the
turf shutter, and observation of the coming hawk through the
field-glass; (3) pulling of the lines A and B, by which the pole-pigeon
and the pole-hawk are made to flutter or fly about and
show themselves; (4) slackening of these lines and escape of
the pole-pigeon, pole-hawk, and shrike, under their respective
places of shelter. By this time the wild hawk ought to be close
at hand, and eagerly looking out for the pigeon which has so
mysteriously disappeared. Then (5) tightening of the line C,
by which the hitherto unseen pigeon is pulled out of his box,
and displayed to the expectant hawk above; (6) capture of this
pigeon by the hawk. Next (7) a much stronger and steadier
pull is given to the line C, by which the far end of it is dragged&mdash;pigeon,
hawk, and all&mdash;towards the ring between the horns
of the bow-net. As soon as the pigeon, with the hawk upon it,
has got to this ring, a piece of tape or ribbon fastened on to a
particular place on the line C will have been pulled to a certain
place within the hut, and will warn the falconer that he need
pull it no farther, as all things are now ready for the next and
most critical move. Then, holding the line C still tight in one
hand, the operator (8) will, with a quick well-sustained effort,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">« 74 »</a></span>
tighten the line D, and pull the net over hawk and pigeon.
All that remains now for the falconer to do is (9) to make fast
the end of the line D round a peg fixed in the hut for that
purpose, and then (10) to run out, with his best leg foremost,
and take the captive out of the net.</p>

<p>The reader may think this rather a needlessly elaborate and
complicated device; but it is a very sure one, when the operator
does not bungle. It has stood the test of many centuries, and
is as good now as it was in the days of Alfred the Great.
There is no doubt that by means of such an apparatus&mdash;slightly
simplified, perhaps&mdash;wild peregrines might be taken on the
Wiltshire and Berkshire downs. Lord Lilford once had a hut
or huts out in England with some success. A similar apparatus,
with a less elaborate hiding-place, would enable keepers or
shepherds to catch many a sparrow-hawk and some merlins.
For the former there is almost always a good demand. So far
is it from being true, as many books assert, that &ldquo;sparrow-hawks
are easy to procure,&rdquo; there are always half a dozen
falconers in England who are vainly wishing that they could
lay hands on one.</p>

<p>To extract a wild hawk of any kind, but especially a ger,
peregrine, or goshawk, from the bow-net is sometimes no
laughing matter. To set about it with thickly-gloved hands
involves much awkwardness, and is not unlikely, in the case
of an inexperienced man, to end in the loss of the hawk. There
is also the danger of breaking feathers, or even a bone in the
wing or leg. On the other hand, to go to work with even one
hand ungloved exposes you, unless you are adroit beyond the
average of human beings, to some particularly painful punctures
and gashes. There are eight talons or claws, each as sharp as
a needle, awaiting your attack, and it will not be the hawk&rsquo;s
fault if she does not maul you with them. As for the beak, it is
well-nigh sharp and strong enough to nip a piece clean out of
the back of your hand. Yet the prisoner must be got out
somehow, and moreover must be held quiet while a pair of
jesses and a hood or sock are put on. A sock is an article of
unpretentious but sterling value to the hawk-catcher. Sometimes
it is not a real sock, but a strait-waistcoat of more
artificial kind made to serve as an improved imitation of the
homely article of clothing originally used by the old falconers.
But the common and unimproved sock is quite good enough
for the hawk-catcher&rsquo;s purpose. It is turned inside out, in the
way familiar to washerwomen, so that at the heel there is an
open end, while the toe and top of the sock form the other end.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">« 75 »</a></span>
Into that open heel is pushed the head of the captured hawk.
The sock itself is then drawn bodily on to and over the
hawk&rsquo;s shoulders. The beak, being hooked downwards, will
not interfere with the operation. The soft covering is pulled
down right over the back, chest, and thighs of the victim, until
nothing but the tail and the tips of the wings protrude. If it
fits tolerably, the hawk will be effectually strait-waistcoated,
and may be laid down on its back like an overturned turtle.
A man&rsquo;s sock, big or little, fits a falcon or tiercel fairly; and
a boy&rsquo;s or child&rsquo;s sock may be used for the smaller hawks.
Before the sock is used a couple of tapes may be sewn across
it, one three or four inches from the toe, and another five or six
inches farther back, so that when it is on the ends of one tape
may be tied&mdash;not tightly, of course&mdash;round the throat of the
captive hawk just in front of the shoulders, and the ends of the
other tape round the back, just above the tail. The toe of the
sock may then be cut off, so that the hawk&rsquo;s head is left free.</p>

<p>The first captive, once reduced to quiescence for the time
being, will be laid out on the floor of the hut or near it, while
the falconer returns to his watch-place. For there is no reason
why he should not effect another, or even more captures, in the
same day. Climatic influences or mere chance may have
ordained that for a week or more he should have had no chance,
and yet now the hawks should come fast and furiously to the
decoy. Long-winged hawks, unlike woodcocks and many other
migratory birds, travel with the wind in their faces; and they
by no means hurry on their way, pausing, sometimes for some
days at a time, at any place where quarry is abundant, where
the bathing is good, and where, perhaps, there are other
attractions which we dull, earth-treading mortals cannot understand
or appreciate. As night comes on, the captives are carried
home in their socks, and a rufter hood is put on, after which the
socks are cut off, and they are set down on a hillock of soft
turf, or, if they show no signs of violent uneasiness, on the
screen-perch, the leash having, of course, in either case been
attached and made fast. From this moment the person for
whom the hawk is intended should by rights assume the
ownership and charge of her. It would be absurd to suppose
that the hawk-catcher, however good a falconer he may be,
should act as trainer too, when he has to go out on the morrow,
and perhaps for many days afterwards, to entrap other hawks.</p>

<p>Before bedtime, in the long evening of late autumn, a grand
attempt should be made to induce the newly-caught hawk to
eat. If she was caught early in the day, and had not already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">« 76 »</a></span>
breakfasted, it is possible that the attempt may succeed,
especially if she is of a placid and philosophic turn of mind.
But do not think that success will, even then, be easily achieved.
You may very likely have to wait a long time. Different men,
of course, have different methods of persuading a newly-caught
hawk to feed; but all agree that it is a very difficult job. Many
of the books advise the drawing of meat across her feet as she
stands on the fist, and repeating this until she begins to pick at
it. Perhaps I have never sufficiently tested this plan. I do not
think I can honestly say that I have ever drawn the seductive
morsel of meat more than a hundred times successively over the
feet of the unwilling feeder. But I must confess that the
process, even when protracted to this moderate length, is a
little tedious. For my own part I have found that, if she is
touched lightly on the shoulder with a finger of the right hand,
she will generally strike out with open beak in the direction of
the offending finger&mdash;not, of course, with any idea of eating anything,
or even any very defined intention of biting her assailant,
but in a mere spirit of anger and defiance. If, then, between
the moment of touching her and that when the blow with the
beak is struck you can substitute in the place of the finger
a juicy slice of raw beef, there is quite a good chance that she
will seize it. At the first trial she will not swallow it. Probably
she will bate off and make a scene. Nevertheless, a certain
taste of very delectable food will linger in her mouth, and when
peace is restored she will take note of this. At the second trial
she may possibly retain the meat a little longer, and make less
ado. By and by a small scrap of it may be torn off before she
gets rid of it; and this, if it is at all sticky, and cannot be
flipped off with a shake of the head, will be swallowed. Now,
if everything is done very gently and quietly, there is a chance
that she may strike out again with some real notion that there
is food to strike at. Directly she takes the meat and gives
anything like a pull at it, let a morsel come off. If the meat is
really quite soft it will be easy to manage this. By degrees she
will, if hungry, begin to take more kindly to the lesson. As
often as you can get a small morsel seized by her, however
unwittingly, she will, if only to get rid of it, pull it with her
tongue down the natural lane where it is intended to go. And
at length she will voluntarily pull through the hood the viands
which are so very ready at her service.</p>

<p>Let her then take as much as ever she will. It is not likely
to be very much. Keep her either on your own fist or on the
fist of some assistant all through the first night, without allowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">« 77 »</a></span>
her to sleep a wink. And until she has fed keep on at
times tempting her to do so. Wild-caught hawks may quite
well be kept nearly twenty-four hours without food. Eagles
may be kept even for two or three days without much injury;
and goshawks for a day and a half. But twenty-four hours is
too long for a very small hawk, which must have been already
hungry when she came to the decoy. And if you can feed any
hawk soon after her capture, so much the better. Anything
like starvation is now completely tabooed by falconers pretending
to any knowledge of their art. To reduce a hawk
while in process of reclamation is no more than you will be
obliged to do. For it is hopeless to expect to keep a passager,
or indeed any trained hawk, in quite such high condition as a
wild hawk keeps herself. But a thin hawk is a disgrace to the
trainer. If you cannot reclaim your hawk without submitting
her to such hunger as will make her weak and poor, you had
better abandon falconry and try some less difficult form of sport.</p>

<p>Possibly before your hawk will feed, and while you are
carrying her, you will find that she wants to cast. With her
last meal eaten in freedom, she is pretty sure to have swallowed
some castings. Ten to one she has thrown these up before she
came to your decoy pigeon. But it is possible she may not.
Moreover, if the first hood she wears is an easy one, well cut
away at the beak opening, she may cast through the hood.
But if she is seen making efforts to cast, and is prevented by
the hood from doing so, take her into a nearly dark room or
passage. Remove the hood with the fingers and teeth, and,
when she has thrown up her casting, slip it on again. Otherwise
she may possibly choke herself in the vain attempt to
cast. Of course you will not dream of allowing her, for days
to come, to eat anything anywhere except on the fist.</p>

<p>If a wild-caught hawk is so rampageous from the first that
she will not stand on the fist at all without jumping off, she
must be left on the turf mound, but by no means be allowed to
go to sleep. An attendant must be at hand who will effectually
prevent this by touching her whenever she seems to be
dozing off. A few hours of this stirring-up will make her ready
enough to keep quiet on the fist when she has a chance. And
a few hours more will make her willing enough to stand still
there, even when the fist is moved unsteadily about.</p>

<p>We will suppose now that the passager has at last fed
moderately but unstintingly through the hood upon the fist;
that she can be carried about on it without much risk of
bating off; and that she has had no sleep since she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">« 78 »</a></span>
brought in. She may now be stroked gently with an uncut
pencil or short stick, first on the back, then on the breast and
legs. Some writers advise doing this with a feather; but the
stick is far preferable. The time has now arrived for releasing
her for a while from the hood. But before this is done, she
must be taken into a room which is nearly dark, so that on
the removal of the hood she can hardly see her way about.
The time chosen should also be when she is sharp-set; and a
tempting piece of food should be under her feet at the time.
As she pulls at it, more light may be let in; and possibly she
will keep at her meal quietly until it is nearly or quite broad daylight
in the place. But most falconers first unhood their hawks
by candlelight. Then one candle may be first lighted at one
end of a long room, when hawk and man are at the other.
If all goes well, a second may be lighted, and then the man,
keeping a sharp eye on his hawk, may walk slowly towards
them into the fuller light. Thus by degrees, taking care not
to proceed too fast, or ever alarm the pupil, she may be made
tame enough to feed bareheaded even in the open air.</p>

<p>The old falconers used to &ldquo;seel&rdquo; their wild-caught hawks,
stitching up the eyelids so as to make them blind; and anyone
who is neat-handed enough to be able to seel a hawk without
causing her any pain or injury may find it a good plan now to
adopt this system. Then, suppose there are four stitches in
each eyelid, on the first day of unseeling the pair nearest the
beak may be removed, and one more pair on each succeeding
day, till the whole eye is free. But seeling, as a matter of fact,
has now gone quite out of fashion in this country. Many
modern amateurs also seem to disbelieve in the expediency of
waking wild-caught hawks, <i>i.e.</i> preventing them from sleeping.
And true it is that this expedient is not absolutely necessary.
But one may safely say that a hawk which is waked well
directly after it is captured will be reclaimed three or four times
as soon and as easily as one which is not.</p>

<p>I have spoken of slipping the hood on and off a hawk as
if it were a thing that the falconer, whether experienced or
not, could accomplish without bungling. But it must not be
inferred that the operation is easy. Probably it is the part of
a falconer&rsquo;s first duties which is more difficult than any other.
Even amongst expert falconers it is not altogether common to
find a really good hooder. The knack of hooding is only to
be acquired, like other fine arts, by long and assiduous practice.
For this reason, if for no other, every beginner should try his
&rsquo;prentice hand on a kestrel before he aspires to a peregrine or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">« 79 »</a></span>
merlin. If he can by any means make acquaintance with a
graduate in the art of falconry who is known to hood well, let
him observe minutely his method and manner, and after each
lesson practise on the <i>corpus vile</i> of the &ldquo;knave&rsquo;s hawk&rdquo; to
acquire the same facility which he has seen his senior to
possess. Example in this case is more valuable than precept.
But do not, by any mistake, become a pupil of a bad
hooder! In the hands of a bungler no hawk can well be good-tempered,
whereas in the hands of a first-rate master she will
stand to the hood as if she rather liked it. When Adrian
Möllen was with the Loo Club in Holland one of the king&rsquo;s
brothers came to him for a fortnight, for an hour every day,
simply and solely to learn how to hood. There are various
manners of putting the hood on. Some hold the base of the
plume between the right forefinger and thumb, and, passing it
slowly up the breast of the hawk, pop it on quickly over the beak,
and with a tap on the forehead push it back into its place.
Others hold the hood by the plume between the fore edge of
the palm and the inside of the base of the thumb, and, presenting
the palm of the hand right in front of the hawk&rsquo;s face, push
it forwards, and cause the beak to pass through the opening,
raising the wrist afterwards so as to force the back of the hood
down on to the nape. In any case there must be an appearance
of quiet deliberation about the movements made, combined
with a certain amount of actual quickness.</p>

<p>The hood used in learning to hood should be an easy one,
very much cut away at the beak opening. And the hawk
herself must be first so far manned that she will allow the
intending hooder to pass his hand over the crown of her head,
and to stroke her on the back without making any objection,
or exhibiting any uneasiness. She should be accustomed to
the sight of the hood, and have often been allowed to pick
nice little morsels of meat from the outside of it. Then she
may be allowed to pick a clean piece or two from the inside of
it; and from the beak opening, under which, as the hood lies
upside-down in your hand, you hold the seductive morsel. If
a hawk is so treated as to become the least <i>afraid</i> of the hood,
it will be a work of dire difficulty, and almost impossibility in
awkward hands, to break her to it, or cure her of the vice.
And hawks are sometimes to be seen so mismanaged by their
owners that they get into a &ldquo;state of mind&rdquo; at the mere sight
of the obnoxious head-dress. A hood-shy hawk is not only a
nuisance, but a discredit to her trainer.</p>

<p>When the hawk has once gone so far as to dip her beak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">« 80 »</a></span>
into the hood in search of a scrap of food, it requires no great
dexterity to slip it over her head. While doing so the knuckles
of the left hand should be turned slightly outwards, so that the
hawk&rsquo;s head is naturally projected forwards towards the hood,
and cannot easily be drawn back; whereas as soon as the hood
is on the same knuckles should be turned a little inwards so
that the head is held up. The braces can then be seized, one
in the right finger and thumb, and the other by the teeth,
and pulled tight, before the wearer can jerk or shake it off.
Merlins are of all hawks the most difficult to hood, owing to
their extreme vivacity and the quickness with which they discern
and anticipate any movement of the trainer. But then
their amenability to kind treatment is also so great that they
can be handled, like a horse or dog, without offence, if a little
patience is exhibited. And, once well broken to the hood, they
will stand to it as well as peregrines or goshawks. Gers have a
reputation for often being hood-shy; but perhaps the proper
treatment of them, in this as in other respects, is now imperfectly
understood.</p>

<p>The early steps in the process of reclaiming passagers were
so well described four centuries ago by Turbervile that I cannot
do better than quote, on this subject, his exact words. After
giving instructions for seeling the captive, and putting on of
bells, jesses, and swivel, he continues: "Being thus furnished
you shall go about to man her, handling her often gently, and
both to avoide the sharpnes of her beake as also the better
rebuke her from biting and nipping, you shall have a straight
smoothe sticke, as bigge as your finger, and halfe a foot long
or more, with the which you shal gently stroke your hawk about
the pinions of her wings and downwards athwart all her train.
And if she chance to knap or byte at the sticke let her bite
hardly, for that will rebuke her thereof, whereas your hand
being twitched away fearfully would make her proceed the
more eagerly. To man her well you must watch all the night
and keepe her on your fist, and you must teach her to feed
seeled; and having a great and easie rufter hood, you must
hood and unhood her oftentimes, seeled as she is [here we see
the advantage of seeling], handling her gently about the head,
and coying her alwayes when you unhood her, to the end she
take no disdayne or displeasure against her keeper. And also
to make her plume and tyre sometimes upon a wing, and keepe
her so on the first day and night without perching of her, untill
she be wearie, and suffer you to hoode her gently and stirre not;
and correct her of her ramage toyes, especially of snapping and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">« 81 »</a></span>
biting, stroking her evermore as before said with your sticke.
But if it happen (as it doth sometimes) that your chance be to
have a Falcon so ramage and shewde-mettled, that she will not
leave her snapping and biting, then take a dose of Garlicke
cleane pilled, or a little aloes cicatrina, and when she byteth or
snappeth at your hand or stick, offer her the Garlicke or aloes,
and let her bite it, for either the strong sent of the Garlicke or
the bitter taste of the aloes will quickly make her leave off.</p>

<p>"And here I thinke good to expresse mine opinion, that hee
which taketh in hand to be a Falconer, ought first to be very
patient and therwithall to take singular delight in a Hawke, so
that hee may seeme to bee in love (as it were naturally) with his
Hawke. For hee which taketh not that delight, but doth rather
exercise it for a pompe and a boast, in mine opinion, shall
seldome prove a perfect Falconer, but a mar-hawke, and shall
beare the bagge after a right Falconer.</p>

<p>"When your Hawke, being so seeled, doth feede well, and will
abide the Hoode, and to be handled without striking or biting
at your hand, then in an evening by candle light you shall
unseele her, and when you have hooded her take her on your
fist, and holde her so all night untill day appeare againe, doing
off her Hoode oftentimes, and handling her gently with your
hand, stroking her softly about the wings and the body, hooding
and unhooding of her and giving her sometimes to feede, a
morsell or twain, or sometimes tyring or plumage. But above
all things you must watch her on the fist so many nights
together without setting her downe on any pearch, that shee
may be wearie and suffer you to hoode and handle her gently
without any manner of resistance, and untill shee have altogether
left and forgotten her striking and byting at your hand;
but some hawkes will be long before they leave that fault, as the
more coy or ramage that they be, the longer they will retain
all those ill tatches, and will not peradventure be wonne from
them in three, foure, or five dayes. When she is well reclaymed
from it then may you let her sit upon a pearch to rest her.
But every night you shall doe well to keepe her on the fist three
or foure houres, handling her and stroking her gently and
causing her to tyre or to plume, alwayes making much of her,
and hooding and unhooding her oftentimes, as before said. And
the like you may doe also by daylight but in a chamber apart
where she may see no great light, untill she feed surely and
eagerly without dread.</p>

<p>"If your Hawke be thus in foure or five dayes manned so that
she begin to feede eagerly and boldly, then you shal first begin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">« 82 »</a></span>
to make her know your whistle or the chirping of your mouth,
and afterwards your voice." And he goes on to advise the
giving of a live pullet in a place where there is just enough light
for the hawk to see it, and then to &ldquo;chyrpe with your voyce
and use those other sounds which Falconers do to their hawks&rdquo;;
and recommends for the ordinary feeding of the haggard falcon,
while being reclaimed, &ldquo;pullets not very old, and calves&rsquo; hearts,
weathers&rsquo; hearts, and hogs&rsquo; hearts,&rdquo; and, if she is not eager
for her food, to wash the meat either in cold water or wine, and
occasionally to give her, fasting, &ldquo;as much sugar candy as the
quantity of a small nut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The duration of the process of manning varies greatly,
according to the breed and individual character of the pupil.
Wild-caught merlins can be reclaimed by a skilled man in a
few days, whereas if you can reclaim a haggard peregrine in less
than a month you will have something to boast of. Short-winged
hawks, if not well waked at the first, generally require a long
time, although this is not invariably the case. Every falconer
is familiar with the story of Sir John Sebright&rsquo;s historic sparrow-hawk,
which killed a wild partridge on the tenth day after it
was caught. But some few sparrow-hawks are as good-tempered,
if skilfully treated, as others are rebellious and obstreperous.
Waking will enable the most unamiable pupil to be manned in
much less than half the time which would be otherwise required.
A judicious use of the hood is also essential. While the hawk
is still feeding freely, unhooded, and with a good appetite, she
should be hooded up before she begins to be at all satiated.
For &ldquo;bating on a full crop&rdquo; is to be particularly avoided at all
times. The remaining part of the meal can be pulled through
the hood. When a hawk eats readily on the fist indoors, she is
not yet more than half reclaimed unless she will do the same in
the open air. There is a vast difference between the one thing
and the other. First take her out a little way in the twilight,
or in an ill-lighted place at night, with food in her foot, on the fist.
Then in the same place when there are men about. By degrees
she will begin to think it natural enough to feed on the hand;
and a tiring, tougher and tougher every day, may be substituted
for the succulent viands by which her attention at first had to
be kept up. Beware at the first, however, of carrying a hawk
bareheaded, unless she has something to amuse herself withal.
The chances are that you may rather make her more wild than
more tame, if she feels that nothing but the jesses and leash
confine her to her new perch.</p>

<p>Throughout this period and during all the early stages of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">« 83 »</a></span>
training, the grand secret of discipline is carrying. It would
perhaps be difficult to say why the mere transporting of a
hawk, hooded or unhooded, upon the glove from place to place
should have so great an effect; but the experience of centuries
has shown that it does, and this ought to be enough for the
beginner. When he has carried hawks for some hundreds of
hours, he will acknowledge the truth of the old theory; then
possibly he will be able to explain it to others or to himself.
In the meantime he will do well to take it on trust, and adopt
the practice without question. If, as he walks about or rides
or sits&mdash;for the ambulatory part of the process is not compulsory&mdash;he
is amongst other people, it will be all the better.
The sound of the human voice, naturally and instinctively
trying to all wild creatures, will by familiarity with it become
less alarming. And with the diminution of the uneasiness
originally caused by the voice will come a lessening of the
distrust felt for the man who owns the voice. It is almost
needless to say that the falconer&rsquo;s voice, especially at times
when the hawk is unhooded and in sight, should be soft and
soothing in tone. We modern trainers do not use the voice
much, as the old falconers did, in educating and directing our
pupils. And therein, probably, we make a great mistake.
But, however incredulous anyone may be as to the charms
of the &ldquo;falconer&rsquo;s voice&rdquo; for which Juliet so prettily sighed, it
is at least natural to suppose that the harsh tones of an angry
or peevish man must give any intelligent animal a bad notion
of his character, and, by analogy, of that of the whole human
race.</p>

<p>The actions of the trainer should, like the voice, be gentle
and conciliatory. In fact his whole behaviour, when in his
pupil&rsquo;s presence, must be, as Turbervile recommends, friendly,
lovable, and free from offence. &ldquo;Sit procul omne nefas: ut
ameris, amabilis esto!&rdquo; And the hawk should not only like
the trainer, but also respect him for his equanimity and self-control.
Do you not want to convince your disciple that you
are wiser as well as stronger than she? and yet that you are
ready to pay respect to her own pride, and even some of her
prejudices? &ldquo;Maxima debetur <i>falconi</i> reverentia&rdquo;; and if
you exhibit petulance and ill-temper yourself, how can you
expect that she will be amiable in return? Rough and sudden
movements must never be made in the near neighbourhood
of an unhooded hawk. Nay, they must be very watchfully
guarded against, or they are nearly sure to be involuntarily
made. Has a gnat got into your eye, as you are walking about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">« 84 »</a></span>
with an unhooded hawk? Your natural impulse is to raise the
right hand quickly to brush it away. But that abrupt movement,
so natural and almost instinctive on your part, is not at
all expected by the hawk, as she stands close by. A catching of
the breath and a half-spreading of the wings, if nothing worse,
will very likely show you that you have made a mistake; and,
if the hawk is a shy one, you will be lucky if the little incident,
trifling as it may appear, does not lead to a bout of bating and
a feeling of resentment and suspicion for the future. When
walking along with an unhooded, half-broken hawk, be on the
look-out for everything that may by any chance cause alarm.
Women are more to be dreaded than men; children more than
women. Dogs are the worst of all, especially if they bark and
rush about. Steer clear of them all at first; and in passing them
keep them always on your right hand, so that they are never
behind the hawk&rsquo;s back. Getting over a gate or stile, be careful
how you step down. The sinking of the left hand always annoys
the hawk standing upon it. Very naturally; for she feels that
her perch is, as it were, dropping away from under her. Do all
descents, therefore, even down an easy flight of steps, with as
few jerks as possible. When riding or driving with a hawk on
the fist, accommodate the whole left arm to the movement of
the horse or the vehicle. A skilled falconer will hold his hand
almost still while his whole body is being jogged about in a
jolting dogcart or wobbling railway carriage. Just as you may
sometimes see a hawk with her eye fixed steadily on some spot,
and her head in the same place, like a fixed star, while her
whole body is moved up or down by an independent action.
Beware also of getting near any obstacle against which your
hawk may by any sudden movement strike the tip of a wing.
In passing through a gate or door, for instance, or under a small
archway, give the gate-posts and walls a wide berth. Never
wear a hard-brimmed hat yourself, nor go near any person who
has a stiff hat or anything stiff about his clothing. In short,
never risk the accidental breakage of a feather.</p>

<p>Carrying is therefore not quite such a simple matter as it at
first appears to be. But it must be persevered in without any
intermission until the hawk is thoroughly manned. For, all the
time the hawk sits contentedly on the fist, she is learning a
lesson that must eventually be taught her. Hawks are amongst
the creatures most easily taught. They learn any lesson skilfully
and diligently taught them with an ease that often
astonishes the trainer himself; and, having once learnt it, they
are in no hurry to forget. The artificial habit, once grafted on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">« 85 »</a></span>
their nature, becomes almost a component part of it. But, as
they learn quickly to do well, so they also learn quickly how to
do otherwise. If you do not make a friend of your pupil, she
will soon begin to regard you as an enemy. And then farewell
to any hope of making a good servant of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Manning&rdquo; includes, of course, habituating her to the company
not only of men, but also of dogs, horses, and all other
animals and things which she is at all likely to meet with in her
artificial existence of the future. She must be gradually introduced
into society; and, like a young lady of fashion, her début will
probably be made at nighttime. Streets more or less frequented
may be visited with advantage by gaslight, or under the rather
weird rays of the electric light. The extent of the publicity
courted must be graduated according to the progress made by
the débutante. If the main street is found too noisy or exciting,
walk away down the side street. If that is too monotonous,
stroll into an inn-yard or a billiard-room. When my lady
shows signs of shying at an approaching object, sheer off a
little, and create a diversion of some kind, perhaps by giving a
pull at the meat under her foot, or by stroking her gently on
the breast with the forefinger or a stick. If she strikes at the
finger, do not snatch it away, but let her see that no harm is
meant. You may even tell her so in a reassuring voice. She
will partly understand. Then, when she can be taken without
trouble through a pretty well-filled street, or amongst a group
of people, she may be brought out by daylight. She may be
carried through the stables and across a courtyard in which
dogs are chained up. Then past a group of stable-boys, and
along the side of a kennel. Meal-times are the best for all
these early lessons, which must be advanced by easy stages.
First the under-falconer will stand by, perhaps with another
hawk, as the pupil takes her dinner. Next day he may be
accompanied by a horse or a hound&mdash;of undemonstrative and
unemotional temperament. On the third day a group of children
may be playing at a short distance. Then the tutor
himself may be mounted when he takes off my lady&rsquo;s hood
and produces the day&rsquo;s ration. At each sign of real alarm the
irritant object should be eliminated. If the stable is found too
trying, step aside into the harness-room. If the children make
too much noise, or begin to stare too impudently at the scornful
beauty, get away to a safer distance. Tempt her forbearance
as far as you safely dare, but not an inch farther. <i>Festina lente</i>
is a capital maxim for the impatient trainer.</p>

<p>Should a half-trained passage hawk ever be pegged out at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">« 86 »</a></span>
the block? Many falconers will answer Yes. But I am of a
different persuasion. A man who is over-hawked, or has too
few assistants, may think it almost a necessity to weather his
hawk at the block. But even in such a case I would advise to
weather her in her hood. The proper way, however, to weather
a hawk, when she is in course of being manned, is surely on the
fist. If a man has so many hawks and so few falconers that he
cannot spare one of the latter to carry each of the hawks for
some hours every day, he is going about his business in an
unbusiness-like way. What good can a passage hawk possibly
get from standing as a prisoner on a block of wood, tempted
continually to jump off, and jerked back as often as she does so
by a rude pull on to a damp plot of grass? The fashion now
so prevalent of pegging hawks out on the lawn by themselves
seems to me, if the truth is to be told, to have originated in the
laziness of the falconer or his subordinates. It is manifestly
much easier and simpler to tie a hawk to a block, than to roam
about with her on the fist. But is it equally beneficial? Is
it even advisable at all? It is argued that a hawk, while so
pegged out, is breathing the fresh air and getting manned, if
there are, as there should be, people passing to and fro before
her eyes. But, on the other hand, she is all the time plagued
by a feeling of discomfort and discontent, which cannot be good
for her. Her position is not natural to her. It is not the one she
would choose of her own accord. Every bird which flits across
within her field of view, every cloud which passes over head,
almost every breeze which whispers in the tree-tops, suggests to
her a longing to take flight. A dozen places invite her to leave
her humble perch and go to them and obtain a better view.
Four out of every five wild-caught hawks, unless their spirit has
been half broken by fasting or persecution, will be found to
bate off constantly when pegged out. And bating off cannot
do them any good. It must remind them painfully that they
are now captives and slaves. Moreover, it is impossible to
properly arrange their surroundings. Either there will be too
many or too few people about. And whoever there is about,
whether man, child, or dog, will either be too near or too far
away. The background will not arrange itself with a due regard
to the happy medium between distant reserve and vulgar familiarity.
On the whole, there are very few passage hawks that
I should like to peg out bareheaded before they have arrived
at a much later stage of their education than we have yet
reached.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Training and Entering</span></p>


<p>We have traced the history of the wild-caught hawk from
the moment of her misadventure in the bow-net to that
in which having been introduced under good auspices to the
society of her new friends she has learnt at least to tolerate
their presence, if not to rejoice in it. She can be taken amongst
men, women, and children, dogs, horses, and carriages, without
feeling uneasy. She has, in fact, now been manned. When we
took leave of our eyesses they had not yet arrived at this stage.
They were only just taken up from hack. But the manning of
the eyess is accomplished in no different way from that of the
passager, except that the more vigorous parts of the discipline
may be omitted or modified. Waking is not necessary for
eyess merlins, hobbies, or kestrels. It may often be dispensed
with altogether with eyess peregrines, even after a prolonged
hack. Carrying and handling are with them, as with their wilder
brethren, the simple but laborious methods whereby they are
tamed. But manning is only the first step in the reclamation
of a hawk. She must be made also to come to the fist, at least
to a certain extent. If, indeed, she is a short-winged hawk,
this lesson of coming to the fist may be considered the principal
part of her training. But all hawks should be taught and
accustomed to jump a short distance on to the fist, whenever it
is held out invitingly towards them. Nor is there any great
difficulty about this, if a right beginning is made. As the
falconer stands with his hawk bareheaded on the glove, he
should get her first to reach forward with her head when he
offers a morsel of food on the end of his short stick. Then by
degrees he may induce her to step an inch or two sideways
towards his wrist for the same purpose. Next, to walk a little
way along the screen-perch. And, when she will do this, he
may set her down on the perch, and, touching it with the open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">« 88 »</a></span>
fingers of the gloved left hand, invite her to step on to them and
to the knuckles. The next short step is to get her to jump
from the perch to the hand. When once she will do this, even
if the jump is one of an inch only, the distance can soon be
made much greater. But in order to succeed with this lesson
she must not be tantalised. It is no good to stand for five
minutes with the left hand outstretched and a piece of meat on
or near it within six inches of your hawk, when she is in no
humour to make the leap which seems to her so perilous.
When she will not come, humour her, and put the meat nearer,
so that she can get it without jumping. Sooner or later she
will find that the meat so placed before her is not a trap or a
sham, but really meant for her delectation, and that she can get
it a little quicker if she chooses to go for it. There is no use
in telling her the story of Mahomet and the mountain, but you
can illustrate the theory by a sort of practical dumb-show. If
a more advanced pupil is placed on the perch next to the slow
learner, the latter will see how much quicker her sister gets the
proffered delicacies by jumping for them. As soon as she will
come a little way from the screen-perch, try her from a block,
and then from a gate-post out of doors. Keep her at this exercise
for some days, but do not make a toil of it to her; merely
let her know that if she comes for it, she will get the tit-bit
at once, whereas, if she does not, she will get it all the later.</p>

<p>Next comes the lure. Passage hawks are notoriously and
naturally bad at the lure. Nothing in their previous experience
at all leads up to it; and you have to teach them an entirely
new lesson. Consequently, you must take pains about it, and
be prepared for disappointments and delays. The lure is as
important to the falconer as a hook to a fisherman, or a bridle
to a rider. To take a long-winged hawk out to the field without
a lure would be almost as silly as to go out shooting without
any cartridges. When first introduced to the pupil the lure
must be well garnished with attractive and palatable viands.
It is by no means enough to throw down a freshly-killed pigeon
in front of the hungry hawk. She is quite likely, if a passager,
to stare at it absently, and apparently without any very defined
belief that it is at all good to eat. After a minute or so she
is not unlikely to look the other way, and pay no more attention
to your well-intended bait. But you must not then be surprised,
or begin exclaiming at her &ldquo;stupidity.&rdquo; If the passager
will not come to the dead pigeon, take a lure and cover it with
chopped meat. Give her pieces off this, and presently let her
pick them off it. Then let her walk towards the lure to get the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">« 89 »</a></span>
pieces, as she has already learnt to go to the fist. When once
she has walked even three inches to it she can soon be made to
fly to it right across the lawn.</p>

<p>Prolong these lessons, therefore, till your hawk is well &ldquo;made
to the lure.&rdquo; Each day at feeding-time make her come a
longer and longer distance to it for her dinner. After a while
she will be flown to it in a creance, that is, a line attached to
the end of the leash, or, better still, to the swivel, from which the
leash has been detached. The best way to give the lesson is to
get an under-falconer or assistant to hold the hawk on his fist
in an open piece of ground, and then, going a little way off, to
show her the lure, on which she knows by experience that her
food is fastened. In the case of eyesses which have been hacked
to the lure they are of course well habituated to the business in
hand. But all hawks, if properly treated, will after a time learn
to look with some eagerness, at the dinner hour, for the appearance
of the lure. Peregrines and all the bigger hawks will be
hooded up before going out; and when the hood is taken off
they will glance around in search of the trainer. As soon as
they discern him swinging his lure, they should jump off and
fly towards it, and, when it is thrown on the ground, alight on
it. Merlins and sparrow-hawks may generally be set down on
a post, and lured from it by the same person who took them
out, without the need of an assistant. Or, when they know the
lure sufficiently, it may be attached to the far end of the creance,
and, after being swung once or twice, thrown to a short distance,
and the little hawk thrown off at the same time, when she is
pretty sure to go straight to it. These exercises at the lure
should be continued till there is no longer any reasonable doubt
that the pupil will come as soon as she has the chance; and, in
order to make sure, the length of the creance may be increased
from a few feet to at least a hundred yards. It will be a proud
moment when first you trust your passage hawk entirely free,
and, detaching the swivel from her jesses, abandon for the
moment all actual control over her. On this occasion you will
probably take extra precautions, making sure that no intruder
will interrupt the operations, and that your hawk is undeniably
sharp-set. But in order to make certain of this, do not dream
of starving her; merely put off the feeding-time for an hour or
so. Hawks in captivity should commonly be fed, as will be
seen later on, at about 11 a.m. When you first fly your passage
hawk free, wait until past noon. The small extra delay will
have put an edge on her appetite. If all goes well she will not
notice or suspect that anything unusual is occurring. Very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">« 90 »</a></span>
likely, if a light line has been used, she may have supposed for
days past that she was flying free. Possibly she has never once
suspected the existence of the creance.</p>

<p>It is well to make all hawks to the lure, even if afterwards
you should have no use for it. A lost goshawk will very often
come to the lure when she will not come to the fist. As a rule,
it will be seen that short-winged hawks in the field should not
be called to the lure; they are &ldquo;hawks of the fist,&rdquo; and should
be taught to come to it whenever they have the chance, in
default of wild quarry. It requires some faith to believe when
the wild-caught sparrow-hawk is first taken in hand that she
will ever do this. Nothing will seem much more unlikely than
that this fierce, restless creature, a feathered termagant, would
ever so lay aside her innate wildness as to come contentedly
out of the free air, and, disdaining all other resting-places, take
perch by preference on the hand of her once detested captor.
Yet so it is. Goshawks and sparrow-hawks can all be brought
to come habitually to the fist, and remain there willingly at all
times except when there is quarry to be pursued. In their case
the calling-off to the hand in the open field is only a prolongation
and extension of the early lessons in which they were
taught to jump to it from the perch, as already described.
After the creance is no longer necessary each kind of hawk
should be called off for two or three days at least, the one to
the lure and the other to the fist, one man holding the hawk,
while the other swings the lure or holds out the fist. And here
ends the early drudgery of reclaiming the wild-caught hawk.</p>

<p>The education of the eyess, whether flown at hack or not,
must, of course, be brought down to the same stage. If they
have had no hack at all they will have been manned very early
in life and habituated to come to the fist. If they have been
well hacked, they will have become in many respects very like
wild hawks&mdash;possibly &ldquo;more so.&rdquo; Anyhow, they will be full
summed and full grown in all respects before they come to
be put in actual training for the field. We took leave of our
eyesses in the third chapter, soon after they had been taken up;
and we must now assume that by a modified application of the
régime prescribed for the haggard they have been manned and
taught to come to the hand or the lure, or both. The time
occupied in this process will of course have varied according to
the disposition of the individuals. A well-natured eyess merlin
hacked under the lure-and-fist system will be manned in two
or three days. A goshawk, or a peregrine of an independent
turn of mind, hacked at the board, may resist for the best part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">« 91 »</a></span>
of a fortnight the best-intentioned efforts to subdue her wild
instincts. It will be well in all cases, and will save an immensity
of time and trouble, to reduce the eyess to some extent as soon
as she is taken up. For my own part I incline to doing, even
at this early stage, a bit of mild physicking. Half a Cockle&rsquo;s pill
for a peregrine or one-eighth for a merlin will do no manner of
harm. At all events the allowance of food must be cut down.
Hack hawks, when taken up, should be as round as balls and
as bumptious as undergraduates. They know not what it is to
be really sharp-set; and unless dosed they make quite a favour
of eating at all during the first two or three days of real captivity.
Continue feeding them at the rate they have been accustomed
to, and you will lose patience before you can bring them under
any sort of control. In fact, you will not do so at all. Yet I
do not mean that they should be made thin. There is, it is
true, no longer any fear of hunger-traces, but a thin hawk is a
weak hawk, and sometimes even a spoilt hawk. Her small
feathers lose their gloss; her flight feathers grow weak and
brittle, and are ready to break on slight provocation; her nares
lose colour, and begin to harbour mites. In short, a thin hawk
is an abomination and a disgrace. She must therefore not be
either overfed or underfed, but just made hungry enough
before each meal-time to be really keen after her food. And
as she has accumulated during her probationary time of adolescence
more or less internal fat, the quickest and easiest way to
get rid of it is to give her a mild dose or two of purgative
medicine, and some rangle, as recommended in the chapter on
ailments. Hack hawks and all other eyesses must be taught to
jump and fly to the fist. If long-winged, they must be made to
the lure. And in all cases they should be thoroughly broken
to the hood.</p>

<p>Thus we have arrived at the same stage with our eyesses
and with our wild-caught hawks; and the subsequent stages
are very nearly the same with each. Carrying (on the fist&mdash;I
do not mean the vice of that ilk) is still a <i>sine quâ non</i>. No
hawk can have too much of it. I have read in some hawking
books a reference to hawks being &ldquo;too tame.&rdquo; The phrase,
as applied to a trained hawk, is not very well chosen, and might
mislead a beginner. Some of the most deadly hawks ever flown
have been as &ldquo;tame as parrots.&rdquo; When a very tame hawk flies
badly it is not, as a rule, because she is too tame, but because
she is too fat, or, more likely still, because she is not properly
sharp-set at the moment of flying. Some remarks on the conditioning
of hawks will be found later on. In the meantime let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">« 92 »</a></span>
not the beginner be afraid of getting his hawk too fond of him.
She should &ldquo;rejoyce in him,&rdquo; as the old falconers expressed it,
and at sight of him be all excitement to come to him, not only
for food, but for the chance of a flight, which she will soon
begin to think that he alone can procure for her. Even wild
hawks will sometimes wait on upon their known enemy, man,
on the chance of his putting up game, and so &ldquo;serving them,&rdquo;
as the saying is. How much more should a trained hawk do,
who is beginning to know that the falconer is a good friend?</p>

<p>Our charges must now be classified in a different way. The
distinction is not now so much between eyess and passager, as
between long-winged and short-winged&mdash;between those which are
to be flown at one or other sort of quarry. Thus, short-winged
hawks of both kinds, eagles, merlins, and all the long-winged
hawks which are to be flown at rook, heron, kite, or gull, are
flown from the fist, whereas hobbies and all the long-winged
hawks which are destined to fly either at game or duck are
allowed to mount to their pitch before the quarry is sprung,
and from thence descend upon it. We may first speak of the
first-mentioned category, premising that as far as safety is concerned
the flight from the fist is preferable.</p>

<p>We assume that the hawk will come readily to the lure or
the fist as soon as she has a chance. Now contrive, if you can,
that your assistant, having her hooded on his fist, shall stand
on an open ground at a distance from you of some two hundred
yards, and that somewhere between you there is a live bird or
beast of a suitable kind on the ground, or in a very small
bush. In the case of a merlin a wild lark may very possibly
be marked down in such a position. So may a blackbird for a
sparrow-hawk, or a rabbit for a goshawk, or even a young partridge
for a peregrine, ger, or lanner. If you cannot manage to
make this arrangement with a wild creature, you must employ
a bagged one for the nonce as a substitute&mdash;a poor one, no
doubt; but it may serve the turn, if used in the way to be
presently described. Now let the assistant unhood the hawk;
and make sure that somehow or other you can put up that
marked quarry when you like. As soon as the hawk has had
time to look round and has looked towards you, let the man
walk in the same direction, and walk in yourself to put up the
quarry. When you are close upon it and are sure that it is
about to rise, you may show the lure for a moment, quickly
hiding it again. And, as the hawk starts towards you, put up
the quarry with a shout. If you are quick enough, it will rise
just as the hawk is approaching the spot where it was, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">« 93 »</a></span>
temptation to her to pursue it will be strong. If the hawk
yields to the impulse, you are in luck. She is already &ldquo;entered.&rdquo;
If she takes it you are still more fortunate, for the hawk is
&ldquo;made&rdquo; at the first trial. But very possibly she may refuse.
No matter, take her down to the lure, and try her again another
time&mdash;perhaps an hour later. Possibly you may possess or
borrow a make-hawk which is already <i>au fait</i> at the quarry&mdash;a
sister or brother of the tardy learner, which has already taken
more kindly to the business&mdash;maybe a last year&rsquo;s hawk, which
is now coming into action again. If such a pupil-teacher is
thrown off as the quarry starts, the force of example will pretty
surely lead to imitation. Rook-hawks are very often entered
in this way. But the plan is advised for the nobler races only,
for short-winged hawks must not be slipped together, for fear
of &ldquo;crabbing&rdquo; or fighting.</p>

<p><i>A propos</i> of bagged quarry, which are an abomination to all
right-minded falconers, it should be said that whenever they are
turned out great care should be taken to deceive the hawk into
the idea that they are not bagged. With this intent dig a
small hole in the ground, just large enough to accommodate
the bagged quarry comfortably. Over the top of the hole and
the quarry inside it place a flat board of the same colour as the
surrounding surface, green, brown, or as it may be. Let the
board be sufficiently heavy to prevent the captive from escaping,
as long as it remains over the hole. Then attach a string of
the required length, and coloured like the board, to one of its
corners. When you want the quarry to bolt, pull the string
and thus uncover the hole. When the liberated prisoner comes
forth, the hawk will be too intent upon looking after it to inquire
why or wherefore it appeared on the scene. If, on the contrary,
you throw it up out of the hand, or let it out of a bag, the case
will be different. Most likely the hawk will see that it is no
chance quarry, but is expressly thrown out as a sort of animated
lure, and pursue it as such. When afterwards you try her at a
really wild quarry, she may refuse, just as if you had given no
bagged quarry at all. Hawks, like other creatures, are averse
to hard work when they think it unnecessary; and when they
are accustomed to easy flights&mdash;such as are always afforded by
birds thrown up from the hand&mdash;they are apt to shirk the more
difficult job of catching a wild bird.</p>

<p>Many hawks are, of course, entered without any such man&oelig;uvring
as above described. An eyess, for instance, which has
begun to chase birds freely at hack may often, when properly
reclaimed, be taken straight out into the field, and thrown off at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">« 94 »</a></span>
the sort of quarry which it is ultimately intended to pursue.
Perhaps two out of every three eyess merlins may, in skilful
hands, be thus dealt with. But they will perhaps not begin at
once. I remember well the first day when Princess was taken
out, as the first of a nest of four merlins intended to be entered.
It was on the open down, where the larks were very strong.
She refused eight in succession, merely making a pretence of
following, and sometimes not even that. But at the ninth,
which got up very near her, she flew with the utmost pluck and
skill, and, after at least half a dozen good stoops, put it into a
potato patch, where it could not immediately be found. She
then refused three more, and ultimately, thinking perhaps that
it was long past dinner-time, caught the thirteenth lark in
good style. Another year Colonel Sanford and I took out
two jack-merlins&mdash;the advance-guard of the hack hawks&mdash;very
early in the season, to be entered at the same time. We threw
them off at the same lark. The hawk which was nearest to it
refused: the other went on and killed the quarry. Sparrow-hawks
will generally fly, if in yarak, without being entered artificially.
With peregrines there is generally more difficulty. As
for those of them which are intended for game or duck, they
belong to the other category, and will be referred to later as
hawks of the mountee. But passage peregrines, coming to the
falconer as they do late in the autumn, will first be flown at
rooks or gulls from the fist. With each of these quarry there
will probably be trouble. For the wild hawk does not, as a
rule, fly at rooks, unless when hard driven for food, nor is she
much addicted to gulls, except at breeding-times, when she has
many mouths to feed. If, when the time comes for her to be
entered, she is started straight away at a rook or gull, without
a make-hawk as companion, she is almost sure to refuse, or take
no notice at all of it. Possibly, if she is first flown at a white
pigeon, in the same place and way as afterwards a gull is sure to
be found, and flies well at the pigeon, she will afterwards go for
the gull. But for entering rook-hawks, where no make-hawk can
be used, a bagged quarry or two is generally found necessary.</p>

<p>When once a hawk has taken one of the quarry at which
she is intended to be flown, she may be allowed to eat it if it is
to her taste. But if its flesh is not of an appetising or palatable
kind&mdash;as, for instance, rook or gull&mdash;a ruse should be adopted to
induce her to believe that the prize is more valuable than it
really is. A freshly-killed pigeon, or part of one, should be
smuggled under the hawk&rsquo;s foot as she is pluming the dead rook
or gull. There will be no difficulty in practising this innocent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">« 95 »</a></span>
deception. Hawks, while pluming their quarry, keep a firm
hold of it with the inner talon of one foot, and often of both.
But it is easy to contrive that the outer talons of one foot shall
get hold of the pigeon, and afterwards to shift the inner talon
on to it. Then, as she goes on feeding, the other foot can be
shifted, and the real quarry stealthily withdrawn from underneath.
As there is nothing that peregrines like better than
pigeon, your newly-entered hawk will, after a meal presented
to her in this fraudulent fashion, take a new view of the merits
of a hitherto despised quarry.</p>

<p>It remains now to warn the beginner in the process of entering
to beware of the hawk&rsquo;s carrying, that is, lifting or bolting
with the quarry. Unless you have very good reasons to suppose
that she will not do this, you should specially guard against it
from the first. When bagged quarry is used, attach a short
light string to it, such as will not materially impede its flight.
After the hawk has made a capture allow her to come with it
quietly to the ground. This she will do if accustomed always
to feed on the lure upon the ground. You will also, of course,
be in a place where there is no temptation, and, if possible, no
reasonable chance, of her taking it up into a tree. Then approach
her very gently and cautiously until you are near enough to
take hold of the end of the string. Having secured this, you
can prevent all attempts at carrying. Do not, however, on that
account hurry up. There is much art in &ldquo;making in,&rdquo; as it is
called. You will have plenty of time; for the mere plucking
or depluming of the quarry (always nearly completely finished
before the meal is begun) will last several minutes at least. Still
holding the string, go up very slowly, advancing a few inches
when my lady is intent on her booty, and stopping when she
looks up. Above all things avoid staring at her, which hawks
greatly dislike. Look any other way than towards her, and
walk rather obliquely towards her than in a direct line. When
you are nearly within arm&rsquo;s reach bend down. You may kneel
or even crawl along like a snake. When you begin to reach out
your hand towards her let it be garnished with a well-looking
piece of food. Get it gradually within reach of her; then close
to her feet; then near enough to touch the real dead quarry.
When you have hold of this you have gained another point.
But be patient and wary still. If you alarm the hawk, even a
little, it will throw you back terribly in your progress towards
making her. It may lead to the abominable vice of habitual
carrying, than which nothing is more annoying and more dangerous.
If by mishap the hawk should bolt, hold on gently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">« 96 »</a></span>
but firmly to the string, and give her still more time before
again approaching her. The art of &ldquo;making in&rdquo; should be
studied and practised from the first. You will afterwards be
amply repaid for all your trouble. See the important remarks
made on this subject in <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">Chapter <span class="smcap">IX</span></a>.</p>

<p>When you have secured the quarry, keep down for at least
two or three minutes more, and let the hawk begin feeding at
her ease on it, or on the pigeon which you may have substituted.
Help her to find the best pieces. You may talk to her in
encouraging words, if such is your habit, while she is eating.
Then slowly get up, lifting the food, and the hawk upon it,
without any haste or jerking. Let her have nearly a full crop&mdash;the
reward of good behaviour&mdash;and subject her to no chance
of annoyance or interference all the rest of the day.</p>

<p>These instructions may seem lengthy and needlessly minute.
If they are, it is a fault on the right side. You are at a critical
stage now in your pupil&rsquo;s education. You are &ldquo;making&rdquo; her to
the business which is henceforth to be the business of her life;
and a little extra precaution is justifiable in order to ensure
that the lesson you are teaching shall be well learnt. As the
hawk finds by experience that you approach her with no predatory
intentions, but rather to help her and add to her enjoyment
of her meal, she will gain confidence, and be less and less
inclined to misbehave herself by bolting. And as her mistrust
diminishes so will your trouble be lessened, until at last you will
be able to make in without any of these precautions and delays.
Whereas, if you are negligent or over-confident at first, you may
end by not being able to make in to her at all, and may have the
mortification of having been for some weeks the owner of a fine
hawk which could fly admirably, but which, after one of her first
few flights at wild quarry, literally &ldquo;vanished into thin air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The training required for hawks which are to &ldquo;wait on&rdquo; is
different. It has already been said that merlins and the short-winged
hawks cannot be taught this accomplishment. A merlin
which will wait on even for half a minute is rather a phenomenon.
I have had such an one, it is true, but only one. The thing is
not impossible in all cases, but so rarely practicable that it is
needless to speak of it. Nor is it advisable to teach the art of
waiting on to any hawk which is intended to be flown at rooks,
gulls, heron, or the like. But all long-winged hawks intended
for game should wait on well. The whole race of peregrines
and their cousins, gers, hobbies, sakers, lanners, and the humble
kestrel, can all be made to wait on beautifully. Soaring (to
which waiting on is so nearly similar) is the natural exercise of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">« 97 »</a></span>
all these hawks. In the wild state they spend hours almost
daily at it. But if they are to wait on in the rather artificial
style required by the falconer, nature must be aided a little.
When they are keen at coming to the lure, you should call them
off, and, as they approach, jerk the lure away off the ground
in front of them. When they have missed it, their impetus will
carry them on beyond the place where it was, and they will rise in
the air, partly turning round to see what has become of it. Then
after a very short delay you may throw the lure down again, and
let them have it. At the second lesson it may be hid for a longer
time, and the hawk allowed to make one or two circles in the air
before it is produced. At each fresh lesson make the interval of
waiting longer, hiding the lure as long as the hawk is circling
round within a short distance of you, but producing it when she
strays away, or gives signs of being tired out. By this means
she will soon learn that patience is not only a virtue, but a
profitable, and even a pleasant one. For if the wild hawk
soars from choice for the mere pleasure of stretching her wings,
it must be natural for a trained hawk, which has so much fewer
opportunities of doing this, to take a delight in it. Eyess peregrines
are very unlike one another in their aptness for waiting
on. Some are very slow to learn it, and can hardly, by the
greatest efforts, be got to go up any height, or even to keep on
the wing at all. Some few, on the other hand, take to it quite
readily, and, after a few days, of their own accord mount to a
great height. Of course the higher a hawk can be induced to
go, the better game-hawk she will turn out.</p>

<p>As for passage hawks, you must remember, when teaching
them to wait on, that there is much more danger than there is
with eyesses. The longer they are kept on the wing, and the
higher they go, the more chance there is of their espying some
bird passing&mdash;perhaps some old familiar quarry, of which
they have struck down scores for themselves&mdash;and making off
after it. The very fact of being in the air, and feeling the free
breeze as it lifts their wings, must remind them forcibly of old
days of liberty, and slacken the ties which bind them to their
new master. Be extra careful, therefore, in the case of all passage
hawks, and most of all with the haggard, to watch for any
signs of returning native wildness. Fly her in a country where
chance quarry are not likely to appear. If she &ldquo;rakes away,&rdquo; or
wanders far from you in making her airy circles, call her back
before it is too late. Fly her always when she is quite sharp-set,
even if you have to give her little or no exercise on some
of the intermediate days between one lesson and the next.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">« 98 »</a></span>
You may diet her now upon &ldquo;washed meat.&rdquo; This is meat
washed in cold water and squeezed dry, so that a part of the
nutriment originally contained in it is lost. It is, of course, less
palatable and less sustaining. But it should be used in moderation.
The old falconers seem to have given it much more often
than we do now. But for some reason or other the nineteenth
century hawk, if at all habitually dieted on this distasteful food,
seems to lose pluck and power as well as weight.</p>

<p>There is another mode of flying hawks to the lure, which
is a sort of combination of the first-mentioned process of &ldquo;calling
off&rdquo; and the last-mentioned &ldquo;waiting on.&rdquo; This is the
practice of &ldquo;stooping to the lure,&rdquo; which is certainly an excellent
means of exercising a hawk, although some very good falconers
object to it on other grounds. For merlins and kestrels, however,
it may be recommended without any reservation. To
teach it, begin, as before, by calling your hawk off to the dead
lure, and jerking it away from the ground in front of her. But
instead of afterwards encouraging her to mount and wait on,
produce the lure, and repeat the same trick by jerking it away.
In order to make the most of this exercise you should rig up a
soft lure, which can be struck in the air. Take a stout bag,
padded on the inside, and into it put a smaller bag, with as
much sand or shot in it as will three-quarters fill it. Sew up
the mouth, and attach to it a strong leash or cord. The whole
apparatus must weigh about two-thirds as much as the hawk
which is to be flown to it. At the juncture of the leash and the
bag attach on each side the wing of a bird, choosing by preference
for each hawk a bird of the kind which is to be her particular quarry&mdash;a
rook for a rook-hawk, a lark for a hobby, and so on. These
appendages will have to be often renewed; and it is well to
keep a stock of old ones, pickled or peppered to keep out the
moths. There will be strings, of course, as in an ordinary lure,
for attaching the food; and particular care is required in garnishing
this kind of lure, as with the hard usage to which it is subjected,
any food which is at all insecurely fastened on may come
off; and if the hawk bolts with it a terrible disaster may be the
result.</p>

<p>At this padded lure the hawk may be allowed to strike freely
in the air as it is swung. Gers and merlins are all very clever at
this work, and often seem to enjoy vastly this opportunity of
exercising their muscles and their intelligence. Some of them
are amazingly clever in getting hold of the lure. Not only do
they foresee exactly where the swing you are giving to the lure
will bring it the moment when they pass; but, if you are in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">« 99 »</a></span>
habit of interrupting that swing by giving it a particular jerk or
twist in another direction, they will discount, as it were, this
trick, and anticipate your little plan. Considerable adroitness
is required on the part of the falconer also. By the employment
of some cunning, he can encourage his hawk to great exertions,
and can very greatly increase both her speed and her footing
powers. If the stoop is very narrowly eluded by this dead lure,
working under your guidance, the hawk is not unlikely to think
that it was her own slowness of flight which made her too late.
If you can encourage this idea, she will strive to improve her
pace, and fly to the lure almost as hard as she would at a wild
quarry. I have repeatedly seen merlins with their mouths open
after five minutes of this work. The best plan is to let the
hawk touch the lure whenever she specially distinguishes herself,
whether by a very hard down stoop, or a high throw-up, or
as it may be. Let the lure be as small as it can be, consistently
with sufficient weight and softness, and whenever the hawk
touches it, whether by your leave or without it, immediately let
it fall on the ground; and let the hawk come down to it, if
she did not bind when she touched. This is a very important
particular in the case of eyesses. It teaches them that a swift
stoop which even grazes the quarry is better than all the slow
ones which miss it. As for passage hawks, they need not to be
taught this. But for them, in consideration of the hardness of
their stoop, I have sometimes found it well to use a modification
of the soft lure. I have diminished its weight and bulk, so that
it can be struck without any fear at all of hurting the hawk&rsquo;s
feet; and at the end of the cord or leash to which it is attached,
I have fastened the solid weight which is necessary to prevent
carrying. This weight may be held in the left hand, while the
lure is swung by the right; and when the successful stoop has
been made, both can be allowed to fall on the ground.</p>

<p>I have said that some great authorities disapprove of this
method of exercising hawks. They say that in the case of
game-hawks it spoils them for waiting on, and that in the case
of rook-hawks and gull-hawks, the habit of looking for the lure
makes them less keen at sighting their wild quarry. There is a
great deal in these objections; and I shall not presume to
decide between the advocates and opponents of the practice.
As regards game-hawks, however, where a hawk has once taken
to mounting well, I should certainly not advise any stooping to
the lure, for fear of spoiling her pitch. As regards other hawks,
I think some part of the force of the objections is removed if
the place where the hawks are stooped to the lure is altogether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">« 100 »</a></span>
different from any place in which they are likely to be flown at
wild quarry. In lark-hawking it is certainly very essential
that the hawk should get sighted at once. But though I have
habitually made my merlins stoop at the lure in the early
morning, I have not found them in consequence slow in starting
at quarry in the afternoon. It cannot be denied that, as far as
the hawk&rsquo;s condition is concerned, stooping at the lure is a
grand resource. If you were always quite sure of giving your
hawk a hard flight at wild quarry every day, that would doubtless
be the best thing for her. But who can be sure of this?
Bad weather, scarcity of quarry, and several other causes make
it only too certain that there will be many interruptions. But
even when you cannot give your hawk a real flight, you can
generally stoop her to the lure, and ensure that she has at anyrate
had a &ldquo;breather&rdquo; during the day. It is very rarely so
windy during a whole day that a trained hawk cannot be put
on the wing. A peregrine in good condition ought not to be
excused by anything short of a whole gale from daily exercise,
even if it amounts to no more than calling off or stooping three
or four times at the lure.</p>

<p>It is a good thing, even after a hawk is fully made and is
flying wild quarry daily, to call her off occasionally to the lure,
though you have no need to do so. Sometimes a hawk will
have a long run of kills without a miss. I have known such a
run to last with a merlin to over thirty. During all the time
while such a score is being made, there will have been no
occasion to use the lure, except perhaps when a quarry has put
in and has had to be routed out. She runs a risk, therefore, of
forgetting all about that humble apparatus, to which a few days
ago she trusted so confidently for her food. Let her memory,
therefore, be refreshed occasionally, by interpolating a fly to the
dead lure amongst the long series of uniformly successful flights.
Otherwise, at the first unsuccessful one, you may find that the
once loved object has lost all its attractions.</p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Rook-Hawking</span></p>


<p>Eyesses, as well as passage peregrines, may be flown at
the rook; but this quarry is more suitable for a falcon
than a tiercel. Mr. O&rsquo;Keefe used eyess falcons for this flight,
and once killed with them on the Curragh of Kildare as many
as 117 in three weeks. William Barr had an eyess which, when
entered to rooks, took as many as seven in nine flights. Comet,
belonging to Mr. Brodrick, took many rooks. It is only rather
exceptionally that a tiercel can be got to fly them. But Mr.
Newcome&rsquo;s passage tiercel, Will o&rsquo; the Wisp, took them very
well. The difficulty which is generally experienced in entering
falcons to rooks is much greater in their brothers&rsquo; case. And
the superiority of the passage hawk over the eyess is more
marked in this flight than in game-hawking. Besides peregrines,
several other kinds of long-winged hawks may be trained to
take this quarry&mdash;gers of both sexes, lanners, and perhaps some
lannerets, and the shaheen falcon, both black and red. No
doubt the saker of both sexes would afford excellent sport
with rooks. I am not aware that the training of any of these
hawks for such a flight differs from that recommended for the
peregrine.</p>

<p>For a rook-flight very open country is required. It would
be no use to attempt it in what is called a well-wooded district,
or where hedge-row trees grow as they do in the far greater
part of cultivated England. A single tree, or even tall bush,
will ruin a whole square mile of otherwise suitable ground.
Nor is it sufficient that the land should be clear of trees and
buildings. Many other obstacles, such as tall, stiff hedges, wire
railings, and even sheep-folds, full or empty, are detrimental to
the sport. A flock of sheep, a drove of pigs, or even a herd of
cattle being driven along, is quite enough to utterly spoil a good
flight. Thus in all England there are but few places where you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">« 102 »</a></span>
can carry on this sport with success. Amongst them are parts
of the Berkshire and Wiltshire downs, and some of the South-downs,
though these are usually too undulating. Parts of
Norfolk, especially near Lakenheath, are good; and so are
portions of the fen country, where there is not too much water.
In the North of England and in several counties in Ireland
there are moors and open spaces which do well.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that the passage peregrine,
or any other of the big long-winged hawks, any more
than the eyesses, take kindly to rook-flying. Some have so
little fancy for this unattractive quarry, that they can never by
any skill be induced to fly them with any zest. Generally it is
necessary to use either a make-hawk or bagged quarry for
entering the beginners. The way in which such quarry are
used has been sufficiently explained in the last chapter. But,
as everyone does not know how to catch a rook, a few hints
borrowed from the sister art of bird-catching may not be out of
place. The commonest way of entrapping a rook is to send a
boy up to the top of a tree in a well-frequented rookery with
the end of a string, with which he can make a noose or nooses,
and set them on the old nests to which the birds resort before
roosting for the night. At the moment when the noisy crowd
come back to the rookery and settle on their accustomed
perches, a simultaneous pull at several lines connected with
properly-laid nooses will generally secure a victim or more.
Another plan by which a rook is made to look even more
foolish is to go round with a plough in a field where rooks come
to pick up the worms which it turns up. The rook-catcher
must be provided with a number of paper hoods made like large
extinguishers, and these he will place upside down in the furrow
with a tempting bait&mdash;grain, worm, or meat&mdash;in their inside.
The rest of the inside of each cap is well smeared with bird-lime
or some other very sticky matter; and the rook, in picking
at the food, may be hoped sometimes to hood himself. Then
while in his astonishment he struggles to get rid of this blinding
fool&rsquo;s cap, he may be picked up and carried off into captivity.</p>

<p>When the newly-entered hawk has taken his bagged rook,
you must get up as quickly as you can and make in at once.
Then seizing the &ldquo;pelt,&rdquo; or dead body of the quarry, you must
contrive so that the hawk, instead of breaking in upon that
unsavoury morsel, shall proceed by mistake to begin her meal
upon a pigeon which you have just before killed, and which you
surreptitiously substitute for by holding it side by side with
the dead rook. The object, of course, is to induce in her ladyship&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">« 103 »</a></span>
mind the belief that she is eating what she has killed, and
finds it uncommonly good. Eyesses are naturally deceived
very easily into this fallacious notion. As for passage hawks,
it is quite possible that many of them have no more idea than
eyesses what a rook tastes like. Unless they have ever been
hard pressed for a meal, it is more than probable that they have
never condescended to dine off a rook. Anyhow, they will not
be at all unwilling to lend themselves to a deception fraught
with such gratifying results. &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; may be the haggard&rsquo;s
inward reflection, &ldquo;what a goose I have been all this time never
to pay any attention to these vulgar black birds! Why, they
taste as good as pigeon!&rdquo; And the next time she has a chance
of paying attention, she will. This &ldquo;personation trick&rdquo; is
invariably used by Indian and Asiatic falconers in kite-flying
with sakers. It is necessary, or at least advisable, in entering
hawks at herons, gulls, and other coarse-fleshed birds. In the
case of rooks it may be discontinued after a short while, if it
is found on a cautious trial that the hawk will eat rook with
any relish. Many falcons, when flying rooks almost daily, are
habitually fed upon the last victim they have killed in the
day. But it is not to be supposed that any hawk will be very
fond of such coarse viands; and some will not eat them at all.</p>

<p>Supposing now that the rook-hawk is safely entered, and a
suitable country found, the next thing is to also find a wild rook
in a suitable part of that country. And this is not altogether an
easy matter. In some very excellent districts, where the rooks
are flown at every year, they become excessively wary, and
quite clever at avoiding the chance of a good slip at them.
The old birds, who have been spectators of many a battle in
the air in which one of their comrades was worsted and lost his
life, or who have perhaps even themselves done battle, and
escaped with great difficulty, become suspicious of all mounted
men. They remember very well and with a fluttering heart the
appearance of the little squadron of horsemen which once
brought with them Lady Long-wing, who made such a dreadful
example of poor papa Caw-Caw. Who can say that they do
not remember the very faces and the green uniforms of the
murderous men to whom Lady Long-wing belonged? Anyhow,
as they strut on the hillside or pick about along the
furrows, they are on the alert directly a detachment of irregular
cavalry comes in sight, which looks at all as if it might be
accompanied by hawks. Very often their sentinels incontinently
give the signal of alarm, and the flock scuds off
summarily to safer feeding-grounds. At all events they do so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">« 104 »</a></span>
long before they can be approached within what a beginner
would consider a reasonable distance. The result is that in
order to get within reach of such quarry it has sometimes been
found necessary to resort to stratagem. Rooks have been
stalked by a falconer on foot creeping along behind the shelter
of a waggon, or actually disguised as a farm labourer. Sometimes
the hawking party will lie concealed under the lee of a
rick, waiting for a distant rook to cross within range, or to be
driven by mounted beaters in the direction of the ambush.
And after all precautions have been taken it is often useless to
wait for a short slip. The distance at which good passage hawks
are now thrown off at Wiltshire rooks will astonish a person who
has never seen anything better than a moderate eyess. A
quarter of a mile is not considered at all too long a start when
a hawk is a fast one and in good flying order. But the longer
the start the better the country must be if you are to score a kill.</p>

<p>A falconer on the look-out for rooks will often have to get
over a good deal of ground in the day. Twenty miles&mdash;without
counting in the flights&mdash;is probably rather under than over
the average distance when any considerable number of hawks
are to be flown. It is, of course, almost a necessity to be
mounted; and it is well to have a horse under you which is not
new to the business, especially if you are to carry a hawk yourself,
or may be called upon to take one up. A horse which has
never been out with the hawks before is likely to be very much
put out by the ringing of the hawk&rsquo;s bell, and still more if she
also flutters her wings in a high wind. While following a
ringing flight your eyes will naturally be directed more towards
the realms above than to the ground over which you are
galloping; and, as many of the downs on which this sport
is most often pursued abound in ant-hills, if your animal
stumbles over one of these obstacles you are likely to pay for
your inattention by a severe cropper. If it falls to your lot to
take up the hawk after she has killed, you must, of course,
dismount. To enable you to do this and devote your whole
attention to it, a special apparatus is provided. To the outside
of your saddle will be attached a pocket, within which can be
fitted a leaden weight secured by a leather, the other end of
which can be attached to the horse&rsquo;s head, so that by merely
throwing the weight on the ground he is at once tethered. No
one of course presumes to take up another man&rsquo;s hawk unless
it has been so arranged beforehand, or in case of urgent
necessity, as for instance if the owner is not in sight, and
there is danger that the hawk may be attacked on the ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">« 105 »</a></span>
by some deadly enemy. Of course rook-hawking may be
attempted on foot. But unless markers are posted skilfully at
the places where a hawk is likely to go out of sight, there is
great risk of losing her. Moreover, it is impossible to see much
of the best flights. A great deal of time will be wasted in
moving about between each flight; and still more in shifting
the markers from place to place, as well as in finding the hawk
after a long flight which has ended in a kill. The rook-hawker
on foot comes back footsore, and very weary. And he is lucky
if these are the only ills of which he has to complain.</p>

<p>Rook-hawks which have been brought out to fly, but are
not for the time actually engaged, either because their turn has
not come, or because they have already flown and been fed up,
are either carried about by a cadger on the cadge, or made fast
to a field-block in a well-sheltered place, or consigned to
perches rigged up in the inside of a van, which can be drawn by
a cart-horse. The latter plan is adopted by the Old Hawking
Club, by which more hawks are usually taken out than could
be accommodated on one cadge. It has the great merit of
serving to protect the inmates from the bitterly cold winds
which often prevail in the rook-hawking season, and also from
the rain. Such a van should be well provided with springs.
Otherwise the jolting, while it passes over rough ground, as it
needs must, would do almost more mischief than the wind or
rain. In any case, whether you go singly with a single hawk
on your fist or with a whole cadge full or van full of hungry
peregrines, the hood will be worn. Nor will it be removed until
the moment arrives when the wearer is to be thrown off. But
when any hawk is being carried with a view to a flight the
swivel will be detached from the jesses and the latter held
tightly in the fingers of the left hand. Some falconers who use
ring swivels in the field, take them off directly the hawk is taken
on the fist for the purpose of being flown, and then slipping
the leash through one ring of the swivel and afterwards through
the loops in the two jesses, are ready to pull it out quickly
when there is a rook in sight and it becomes possible that they
may have to throw off at any moment. Some also, when a
flight is pretty sure to begin shortly, loosen the hood&rsquo;s braces
without taking it off, so that there may be no delay in
whipping it off at exactly the right moment. No one has ever
been able to explain how it is that peregrines can emerge
suddenly from utter darkness into the full glare of daylight,
with eyesight as good as ever, ready in the very first moment
to catch sight of a distant rook and to begin the chase. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">« 106 »</a></span>
they have this faculty everyone knows who has ever seen a
rook flown by a trained peregrine. Fortunate for the falconer
that it is so, as he can choose his own moment for the throw-off.</p>

<p>If you are intending to fly a hawk for the first time at a wild
rook, get some other person who is out with a made hawk to be
also ready with her. Then, if the first chance at a rook is not
an easy one, let that other person throw off his hawk and keep
yours for a less difficult flight. Wait, if possible, until you can
find a quarry which is not too far off and not high in the air.
If you can get up within a hundred yards or so of one on the
ground to windward of you, so much the better. The moment
he jumps up, off with the hood, and with a steady movement of
the left arm forwards, something like that of a left-arm slow
bowler, launch your hawk into the wind. Use whatever cry of
encouragement you like, or use none at all; at anyrate, not any
cry which you may have used in calling off. And if, in the
excitement of the moment you should not throw away the
hood, but stuff it into your pouch or pocket, that will also be
satisfactory. If you drop it you are not likely to find it on the
open down without some hours&rsquo; search, if at all. Such presence
of mind is, however, I am aware, rather too great to expect.</p>

<p>A rook with any self-respect about him will begin to mount
as soon as he is aware that he is being pursued. And of this fact
he will not be long in ignorance. Seldom does a trained hawk
make half a dozen strokes of her wing before the quarry espies
her and knows exactly what she means. With this knowledge
the black-a-moor of the air wakes up, and then, if never before,
he is on his mettle. Few people know how a rook can fly until
they have seen him in front of a peregrine which means business.
His wings are broad and strong, and not much worse shaped
than a hawk&rsquo;s. His muscles are good; and by reason of much
daily exercise in all weathers he is in good condition&mdash;better
far, perhaps, than your passage hawk, which was cooped up
inactive for weeks, and only during the last fortnight or so has
had a modicum of exercise while flying to the lure. The two
birds will breast the wind as they mount; but not necessarily
taking the same line. Sometimes the two lines will diverge so
much that from your point of view behind, the birds seem to be
flying away from one another. Generally speaking, the better
the hawk the less slavishly will she follow the course taken by
the quarry. She flies &ldquo;with her head,&rdquo; and, trusting for victory
to the long, powerful stoop, concentrates her efforts on attaining
to a position from which she can deliver it to best advantage.
Thus if, the wind being north, and the safest shelter west, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">« 107 »</a></span>
rook shapes his course to the north-west, the falcon may very
probably steer due west. By doing so she makes sure that she
will soon be almost between the quarry and that desirable place
of refuge. To make it he must come right past her and under
her. Or else he must keep away and make for another covert,
and in that case he will have a long way to go; and there will
be time to catch him up, and get between him and that other
haven. To passage hawks, especially haggards, this finessing is
the A B C of scientific flying. Moreover, an experienced hawk
does not always choose to stoop exactly up-wind, but prefers,
for some reason of her own, to come at her victim sideways.
There are mysterious laws and principles of aërial steering,
which no man understands, but which sometimes make a stoop
more telling when made in a direction unexpected by the riders
down below. Eyesses are generally some time before they
learn the art of utilising the wind to increase the force of their
stoop, and of using their heads to help their wings. Some, it is
true, seem to be born good tacticians, or at least to have instinctively
learnt to be so while flying at hack. But these are quite
the exceptions. Not only do eyesses as a rule begin with an
inferior style, but very few of them ever attain to the perfection
of form which long practice in all weathers at all sorts
of different quarry has taught the old wild hawk.</p>

<p>As the two birds mount, the hawk naturally gains on the
rook. She is the quicker flier; sometimes, perhaps, by a
hundred per cent., but generally much less than this. Going
down-wind there is not so much difference between them, when
both are at the same height. But the start at a rook should
always be up-wind. To throw off at a down-wind rook is bad
falconry. When a rook means to &ldquo;keep the air,&rdquo; or beat the
hawk in fair flying, he will, after a while, begin to ring, that is,
to ascend spirally in circles. Why he should do this, instead of
continuing in a straight line, no one, I think, has properly
explained. But the road upwards for most birds when they
are exerting themselves&mdash;be they kites, herons, rooks, or larks&mdash;is
in spiral circles more or less regular, a very obliging dispensation
of nature for those who want to look on at a high
flight! For while the ringing lasts the horsemen down below
need not hurry themselves. Only, if there is anything of a wind
they should always keep moving, so as to be well to leeward of
the flight, shifting their ground to right or left according as the
circles seem to tend in one or the other direction. The higher
the quarry goes the faster and farther will be the headlong dash
down-wind if he is beaten in the air. After a while, if the hawk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">« 108 »</a></span>
perseveres, her superior flying powers will take her above the
quarry. At what time and height this desirable result is
brought about depends, of course, partly upon the speed of the
one bird and partly on the speed of the other. There is a
saying among falconers that a good hawk makes a bad quarry,
meaning that a rook or other bird which might give a fine
flight when only a moderate hawk was behind him very often
makes quite a poor show against a first-rate performer. It
may also be said with some truth that a good quarry makes a
bad hawk, inasmuch as hawks which have flown many a good
flight and killed many a fairly fast-flying rook may sometimes
find themselves pitted against such exceptionally strong ones
that they seem unable to get above them, and give to the
stranger an appearance of being slow themselves.</p>

<p>A good and experienced falcon or other rook-hawk will not
be content with merely getting above her quarry before she
makes her first stoop. She will go on ringing until she is so
far above that the first stoop will be a good one. That is
to say, that she may be able to get such an impetus upon
her in the dash downwards as to rush up to the rook hand
over hand, or, as the racing men say, as if he were standing
still. And, having so run up to him, that she may, if she misses
him, utilise the remainder of her impetus in shooting up again
in preparation for a second stoop. The rook, on his part, when
he finds the falcon above him, has to choose between two
courses. Either he will persevere in trying to keep the air&mdash;and
in that case must trust to quick turns and twists to elude the
foe&mdash;or he will adopt the less valiant but almost equally
dangerous alternative of a race to the nearest covert, with the
necessity of eluding a certain number of stoops on the way.
In the first case the flight will become a sort of improved
version of coursing. Improved, because a bird has so much
more varied chances of throwing out his pursuer than the hare,
which can turn only either to the right or the left. He must
always be on what the mathematicians call the same plane.
The rook, on the other hand, may, if he likes, double simply to
right or left. But he may also, if he prefers it, duck downwards
or shoot upwards, allowing the hawk to pass over him or under
him. Or he may turn partly upwards or downwards, and partly
to either side. Thus there are an unlimited number of angles
at which he can swerve away to avoid the stroke.</p>

<p>The art and science of &ldquo;shifting&rdquo; is indeed one of the most
elaborate that is possessed by the dumb creature. Almost all
birds cultivate it to a certain degree. Instinct suggests it to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">« 109 »</a></span>
them; but many birds improve upon their natural powers by
frequent practice. Who has not seen one rook chasing another,
either in sport or in a petulant humour, and the fugitive
evidently enjoying the fun of throwing out his persecutor? In
the tropics there is nothing that a crow likes better than stooping
at kites; and nothing that the kite takes greater pride in
than showing how easily he can elude the shots so made at him.
I have seen pigeons, when a slow or lazy peregrine is in the air,
deliberately hang about within reach of her for the express
purpose of enjoying the amusement of successfully shifting
when she makes a dash for them. Indeed, it will be seen in
<a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">Chapter <span class="smcap">XIX</span>.</a> that I saw this game played rather too rashly by
a house-pigeon with a trained ger-tiercel. It has been said that
the rook in full plumage is no mean flier. He has also a good
head on his glossy shoulders, and he shifts cleverly enough
while his lungs and muscles hold out. He does not often lose
his head, in the metaphysical sense. Sometimes, when particularly
close shots graze him, or even feather him, he is frightened
into wasting a little breath in an angry complaining croak.
But this is almost the only piece of stupidity that can be alleged
against him. Usually, however hard pressed, he keeps all his
wits about him; and when he is beaten in the air, it is oftenest
from sheer want of speed and want of wind. The violent effort
required to escape by shifting a good stoop of a first-rate
peregrine takes it out of him terribly. The whiz of the falcon
as she rushes by is enough to make the stoutest heart quail.
But cowardice is not the weak point of the rook, who, for the
most part, has a determined and fair struggle for his life.</p>

<p>Of course the stoop takes it out of the hawk also. But then
the hawk has two great advantages. She is the faster bird, and
she is better at the &ldquo;throw up.&rdquo; This is the counter-move by
which she responds to the shifts of the quarry. A good long-winged
hawk, after an unsuccessful stoop, immediately shoots up
to a great height above the place where the stoop was intended
to take effect. She rebounds, as it were, from the rapid descent,
glancing upwards with wide open wings to a new position of
advantage. And herein she has the advantage of the greyhound.
The farther the dog is thrown out, the more laborious
is the work of getting into position for the next attack. But a
falcon may come past her quarry with as much way on as ever
she can command. That impetus need not carry her away to a
disadvantageous position, but, on the contrary, to one where
she is still admirably placed for a fresh stoop. By throwing up
well and with good judgment, and sometimes a little luck, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">« 110 »</a></span>
good hawk after once getting well above her rook will keep the
command of the air for the rest of the flight. The quarry
may throw up too; but if his pursuer makes the most of her
first advantage, he will always find her above him after he has
done so. It may be that she will be very wide of him. But
distance calculated in mere length counts for comparatively
little. It is the distance in height from the earth below that
makes all the difference.</p>

<p>Consequently, if the rook persists in trying to keep the air,
and Lady Long-wing has the pluck and the condition to keep up
the chase, the time comes sooner or later when the shift is not
strong enough or not quick enough. Then as you watch the
two birds&mdash;or the two little specks, as they may by that time
have become&mdash;the lines along which they are moving will be
seen to converge and not separate again. There will be a shout
of jubilation from below. &ldquo;Who-whoop&rdquo;: it is the death-cry.
One of those eight sharp talons which, half hid by feathers, arm
the lower side of the hawk&rsquo;s body has hooked itself into some
bone, or at least some fleshy part, of the victim&rsquo;s body. Then
from the under side of the slim falcon, as she spreads her wings
and sinks nearer into sight, will be seen hanging a confused
mass of black shiny feathers. As the two birds&mdash;victor and
vanquished&mdash;come down to earth, the former will sometimes
be seen tightening her grasp or catching hold with the second
foot. At anyrate, within less than a second after they have
reached the ground, the deadly clutch of the conqueror will be
on the head of the conquered. In another second or two the
point of her beak will have broken the victim&rsquo;s neck at the top
of the vertebral column. No man can encompass the killing of
a rook so speedily and neatly as can a peregrine. Within a
marvellously short time after the last stoop was delivered, the
head of the captured bird droops inert from the dislocated neck,
and life is completely extinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">« 111 »</a></span></p>

<p>Such is the finish of a ringing flight flown out on both sides
with unflagging courage&mdash;the sort of flight which every true
sportsman would like to see often in the hawking-field. But
much more often the rook, when getting the worst of it in the
air, abandons the hope of beating his foe in fair mounting and
fair man&oelig;uvring. Taking advantage of some moment&mdash;perhaps
after an ineffectual stoop&mdash;when his foe is a trifle wide,
and on the side farthest from a covert which he has marked as a
possible place of refuge, he turns tail, and makes off&mdash;down-wind
if possible, or if not, across the wind&mdash;to that seductive
shelter. A wood or spinny is what he would prefer, but a tree
of any kind will do&mdash;the taller the better. A farmyard or a
flock of sheep, even a hedge or an empty sheep-fold, or a waggon&mdash;anything
behind or around which he can save himself from
the dreaded stoop. In any, even of the least effective refuges,
there will be at least a respite. And if that very poor stronghold
is found untenable, he can begin a fresh retreat to a more
promising place, with recovered wind, and perhaps better luck.
Often a rook will make for a rather distant plantation, with a
nearer shelter of an inferior kind in view as a <i>pis aller</i>. The
hawk, of course, knows as well as he what he is after, and
follows at her best pace. Now is the time to ride hard. Even
with a moderate wind the birds will be travelling over a mile a
minute. Ride as you will, they will be over your head long
before you are near the covert, if it is at all distant. Lucky if
you are even in time to be near when the first down-wind stoop
is delivered. The down-wind stoop of a peregrine is terrible.
It is often avoided, no doubt, but the impetus, if she misses,
carries her on right ahead of the rook, over the place where he
must pass if he goes on. And there she is, blocking the way
to the desired haven. She can poise herself steadily for the
next shot, choosing her own time for it, and will have every
possible advantage over the rook, which has to run the gauntlet
of those eight dagger-like talons. The last stoop before reaching
covert is very often fatal. The hawk knows that probably it is
her last chance of catching hold, whereas in the open she is
aware that a very fast stroke, though not quite accurately aimed,
will do a great deal towards taking the nerve and strength out
of her quarry, and make him easier to hit later on.</p>

<p>If the rook once makes a plantation of any size, he is safe.
No human power can drive him out. Peregrines, of course, will
not go into cover after their quarry. Now and then a young
hawk at hack will try to do something vague in the way of
cutting down or dislodging a bird which has put in; but such
attempts are dismal failures, and are hardly ever even thought of
by &ldquo;grown-ups.&rdquo; If the rook has put in to a very low tree or a tall
hedge, he may often be dislodged by throwing sticks and stones
at him, or sending a boy up. Sometimes snapping a cap on a
pistol, or cracking a whip, or making any other sudden and loud
noise, will put him on the wing again. But before going far, he
is only too likely to put back to the same place, or to a neighbouring
tree, if one is near, or to another part of the hedge.
Even when the shelter is only a low line of hurdles, it is quite
difficult to hustle out a rook so that the peregrine, waiting on
above, may have a fair shot at him. A big tree is generally a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">« 112 »</a></span>
safe refuge. If you send anyone up, the refugee will only shift
his quarters to another branch. And all the time while you are
trying to get him out, the hawk will be circling above&mdash;if,
indeed, she does not get tired of waiting, and start after some
other quarry. With a passage hawk which has not long been at
work, you cannot risk keeping her long in the air on the chance
of your routing out a rook that has put in. She may check at
a passing pigeon, or at a quite distant flock of rooks, or any
other bird which she was once wont to kill, and then, even if
you are well mounted, you will have great difficulty in keeping
her in sight. If, therefore, you are hawking with a passager, and
cannot get your rook out quickly, take her down with the lure,
and have a try later on at another rook in the open.</p>

<p>If the hawk kills, the falconer will get up at once, and &ldquo;make
in&rdquo; in the manner described in the chapter on Entering.
There is not much danger of any attempt to carry when the
quarry is as big a bird as a rook. But caution should be
observed, nevertheless, as, if you are rough or in a hurry, you
may induce in the hawk a disposition to carry, which on some
future occasion may cause no end of trouble. Do not even now
let your hawk feed upon the rook, unless you are quite sure
that she likes such food. Take care that from the first she
shall be well pleased with having taken this quarry, which is not
the one she is predisposed to fancy. If in doubt about her
liking for rook&rsquo;s flesh, substitute a pigeon. And it is as well to
be contented with one kill on the first day. A fresh flight
might not end so happily, and would then partly annul the good
effect of the one that has succeeded. Besides, you want to
reward your hawk for her victory by giving her a good feed at
once, which of course you could not do if you intended to fly
her again. Be well satisfied, therefore, that the first step has
been made towards making a good rook-hawk. After a few
more flights, if even a moderate percentage of them end well,
your pupil will begin to take a delight in the business. Sometimes
she will become so keen at it that you can freely let her
feed upon the last rook she kills in the day. Only do not give
her too much of this food. It would be a thousand pities if,
after having acquired a liking for this flight, she should, for the
sake of a small economy to her owner, be allowed to become
disgusted with it.</p>

<p>Rooks may be flown as soon as the passage hawks are
trained. Old peregrines can of course be flown at any time
(except when there are young rooks in the nests). But the
winter and early part of the year is the best time, as later on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">« 113 »</a></span>
the young crops preclude the possibility of riding over arable
land; and it is impossible to ensure that the area of a flight
shall be confined to the open downs. It is on some broad
expanse of turf, however, that the quarry should be found, if
you are to enjoy a good gallop and a proper view of the flight;
for if you have to jump fences, you must needs take your eyes
off the birds, and it may then be difficult to catch sight of them
quickly again. You should not fly at a rook if there is any
tolerable covert within half a mile down-wind, or a third of a
mile on either side. The distance up-wind to the nearest covert
need not be so great. When a rook is just rising off the ground,
you can of course give him more law than when he is already
on the wing. For, as has been said, height in the air counts
very much more than distance along the flat. Even the small
elevation from which a hawk starts as you carry her on horseback
gives her a certain advantage over the rook which is only
just off the ground. Rook flights often end more than a mile
in a straight line from the start. But generally this is equivalent
to saying that the distance flown has been more than double as
much, by reason of the doublings and up-and-down dashes which
both birds have made. In following a flight, it is best to keep
about a quarter of a mile to leeward, or as near this as you can
get, while keeping a good view of the scene. As the rook gets
higher, still keep well to leeward, until you are pretty sure what
covert the rook will ultimately make for. A little practice will
generally enable you to make a pretty good guess, although
perhaps for a while the rook may be heading a different way.
If you are wrong, and find yourself thrown out, perhaps the best
plan is not to ride hard in the vain hope of getting nearer, but
take out your field-glasses, and watch the flight from about
where you are. Each man out who knows enough about hawking
to be able to take up a hawk, should carry a spare lure, so
that, in case of a lost hawk, he may try for her in his own
direction, while others are engaged on the same task in theirs.
Agree beforehand, however, with the owner of the hawk, that if
you find her you may take her up.</p>

<p>Falcons are generally flown single at rooks, except at the
time of entering them with a make-hawk. In a double flight I
think that the rook is as a rule a bit overmatched, that is, if
the hawks are in proper fettle. But for entering a backward
hawk, or encouraging one which does not take kindly to this
flight, it is very useful to use a make-hawk, that is to say, one
which is already keen in the cause. Most hawks are very
strongly influenced by example; and a young eyess particularly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">« 114 »</a></span>
recognising as she does the superior style of a haggard or
passager, will readily imitate her, and join in a chase upon
which she sees that the other has embarked. A double flight
is very pretty, and very effective. The way in which the two
hawks assist one another, waiting each for her turn to stoop,
and making her plans so as to profit by the action of her
comrade for increasing the force of her own strokes, is interesting
even to the most careless observer of animal life. But the
double flight is better reserved for such more arduous undertakings
as the pursuit of kites, herons, and gulls. A few words
will be said in a later chapter about these quarry and the sport
they afford. But in all the main particulars it resembles that
which has been here described. The rook flight is at once the
commonest and the most typical form of sport when the hawks
are flown out of the hood; and he who has successfully trained
a peregrine to this business should have no great difficulty in
making any other of the large long-winged hawks to such other
quarry.</p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Game-Hawking</span></p>


<p>Partridges, pheasants, and other game birds may be
killed with several kinds of hawks. In ancient times it
seems that the former were taken in England with the jerkin,
or male ger, and occasionally with the gerfalcon,&mdash;though this
was mostly reserved for much bigger quarry,&mdash;with the peregrine
falcon and tiercel, the lanner and lanneret, the barbary
falcon and tiercel, the male goshawk, the female sparrow-hawk,
and sometimes even the tiny merlin and almost equally diminutive
hobby. In our times most of these varieties have been
almost disused for the flight at game birds, for various reasons,
the chief of which is that peregrines are found to be more useful
at it than the other sorts. It is true that goshawks have been
flown quite lately both at partridges and pheasants, and with
some success; and it will be seen in treating of the sparrow-hawk
that she has also done some execution amongst the
denizens of the swedes and stubbles. Even merlins have been
found occasionally to take a young partridge in September.
But goshawks and sparrow-hawks are seldom speedy enough to
catch many full-grown partridges, unless they can be approached
nearer than is usually the case nowadays. Probably not more
than one merlin in fifty could be induced to fly partridges with
any zest; and not one in a hundred could hold a full-grown one
on the ground without great difficulty and risk to the tail
feathers. And, as merlins will not wait on, the flight with them
at partridges, if it were to be accomplished, would lack the chief
attraction of game-hawking, and not be much worth seeing.
The lanner and the barbary, as well as the ger-tiercel, would still
certainly show good sport with game; so would the two kinds
of shaheen, and very possibly the saker. But the supply of
these hawks is extremely limited; and the climate of England
does not suit them so well as the peregrine. Moreover, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">« 116 »</a></span>
mode of training and flying them does not materially differ
from that of the commoner and hardier bird. It may be
assumed, therefore, for the purposes of the chapter, that game-hawking
means, what falconers generally understand by it, the
flight with peregrines at grouse, black-game, or partridges.
Pheasants, snipe, hares, and woodcocks will be dealt with in
another chapter.</p>

<p>Grouse and black-game hawking differ in no important
particular from partridge-hawking; and, generally speaking,
what is to be said about the latter may be said with equal truth
of the other two. It should be mentioned, however, that falcons,
from their superior strength, are much to be preferred for the
flight at the bigger quarry. Although there have been cases
where tiercels have done well at grouse, these are exceptional.
Usually they are averse to tackling so heavy a quarry, and, of
course, still more reluctant to take the field against blackcock.
They are, however, perfectly equal to the flight at partridges.
Some falconers have even professed to prefer them for this
flight to their sisters. This, however, was not the view taken
in the classic age of falconry; and if a fair comparison is
made the falcon will be found to be at least as good for the
stubble-fields, while vastly superior on the moors. Here again
the method of training and working, whether the one sex or
the other is used, is identically the same.</p>

<p>In game-hawking, the eyess is much more on even terms
with the passager than in the flight out of the hood at rooks and
larger quarry. In fact, some of the very best and deadliest
grouse-hawks in modern times have come from the nest to the
falconer&rsquo;s hands. The records of the Old Hawking Club show
a quite exceptionally brilliant score made by one of their eyesses,
Parachute, who took no less than fifty-seven grouse in one
season, heading the list of that year&rsquo;s performances on the
Club moor. In the same year, 1882, Vesta, an eyess of her first
season, killed as many as forty-three grouse. Yet it must not
be inferred from this that every nestling is as likely to kill
grouse or partridges as well as a passage hawk. It is rarely
that the latter does not fly at least creditably, when trained,
whereas with eyesses the general rule is rather the other way.
A really first-rate performer is amongst eyesses the exception,
however well they have been hacked and trained. On the other
hand, the making of the eyess to this flight is beset by few of
the difficulties which trouble him who would train a wild-caught
hawk to it. It has been said already that a passage hawk, waiting
on at any height, must naturally be more apt to check at passing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">« 117 »</a></span>
birds than an eyess. The latter has been, or ought to have
been, reserved, from her youth up, for the one flight for which
she was specially destined by her owner; whereas the other,
from her youth up, until captured, has been accustomed to fly
at whatever happened to be most ready to hand. There is, too,
generally a special reason why the passage hawk should be
apt, when expected to wait on for game, to check at any rook
which may be in sight. As a rule she has come into the
trainer&rsquo;s hands in the late autumn, has been deliberately entered
by him at rooks in early spring, and has flown them with his
entire approbation for some weeks. No wonder, then, that if on
the twelfth of August a rook comes past she should think it her
duty to go for him.</p>

<p>Let us, however, speak of the eyess first, and we can see
afterwards what modifications are to be made in the case of the
older hawk. When your pupil will come well to the lure do
not keep her long, if at all, at work in stooping at it. On the
contrary, let the interval between the time when she is thrown
off and the time when she is invited to come down on the lure
be as long as possible. Keep her on the wing as long as you
dare. But you must not at first go too far in this direction.
If you wear out her patience she may go to perch, either on the
ground or perhaps in a tree half a mile away. Take her down,
therefore, if you can, before she is too much tired. But if you
should make a mistake, and the inapt pupil goes to perch, do
not hurry after her, unless there is any special reason for doing
so. Stay where you are if she is well in sight; or, if not, move
to a spot where she can easily see you, and do not have the air
of pursuing her. Make her understand that, in this case, it is
she who must come to you, and not you to her. When she finds
after a long sojourn in the tree or on the ground, that after all,
she has either to trouble herself to come or else go without her
food, she will be less likely to be troublesome next time. She
will think to herself, &ldquo;What was the use of all that delay? I
might as well have kept on the wing and had my dinner sooner.&rdquo;
Such reflections are very salutary. You do not want to be
beat by your pupil, but your pupil to be beat by you, and to
learn that your way of doing things is the best both for her and
for you. She will learn it, too, if you go the right way to work
and persevere. With an eyess you have the whip hand. She
cannot easily feed herself without you; and she knows it. For
weeks she has been indebted to you, directly or indirectly, for
her daily rations. Even in her wildest days at the end of hack,
when she would let no one come near her, she was often watching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">« 118 »</a></span>
you with eager eyes as you put out her meat on the hack
board, and since that, have you not always either given her her
food on the lure, or at all events taken her to a place where she
could fly and kill a quarry which you had put up for her?</p>

<p>Have patience with her, therefore, and induce her by slow
degrees to go up higher and higher. You must use all
imaginable devices to accomplish this main object. Try to
make her understand that the higher she goes the more chance
there is of your producing the lure. Thus, suppose she has
made three or four circles without going more than forty feet
high, and in the next goes to fifty or sixty feet, bring out the
lure and let her have it. Here is another device. Two men go
out, each having a lure. One stands on higher ground than the
other. Then call off the hawk alternately, each man showing
his lure in turn, and hiding it as the hawk comes up. But
let the man on the upper ground never indulge her with any
success. When she is gratified let it be when she comes from
above. She is not unlikely to associate the idea of success with
that of toiling upwards and then coming more swiftly down.
This is, moreover, a view of the matter to which the minds of
all hawks are naturally prone. The flesh is weak, particularly
in eyesses, but the spirit knows that the proper way to earn a
living is to mount and then stoop down.</p>

<p>It is not good to defer needlessly the moment when you
give your hawk a flight. Flights at quarry, even if it is
bagged quarry only, almost always improve the mounting of
a hawk. Why? Because first nature and then experience
teaches her that from a height she has more chance of catching
a live bird. It is not a bad plan, if your hawk mounts badly,
to start for her (from a place of concealment, of course) a fast
house-pigeon at a distance of five or six hundred yards up-wind
from a thick covert. She will have plenty of time to make a
stoop or two in the open. But she will almost certainly fail,
and the pigeon will get off easily into shelter. Then if your
hawk comes back to you at a good height, give her a much
worse pigeon, which she will have a good chance of taking. If
she comes back low, take her down to the lure, and save the
second pigeon. The next day you may take out two pigeons&mdash;a
good and a bad. If your hawk mounts better give the bad
pigeon; and if not, give her again the one which she will not
be able to catch. These are not infallible methods; but they
may succeed, and they are worth trying, when a hawk is averse
to mounting naturally. In the lone hours of darkness, when
her hood is on, such a hawk may fight her battles over again,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">« 119 »</a></span>
and inquire seriously of herself what was the cause of her ill-success.
And, reflecting on the experiences of hack, she may
very likely conclude that she could have done better if she
had started in pursuit from higher in the air.</p>

<p>The old falconers had a device which is not often adopted
now, but which seems to have been effectual, at least, in some
cases. They &ldquo;seeled&rdquo; (see
<a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chap. <span class="smcap">V.</span></a>) the bagged quarry,&mdash;usually
a duck or a pigeon,&mdash;and the effect was that, when so
blindfolded and let loose, it flew upwards, like a towering partridge,
avoiding the risk of striking against obstacles which it
could not see. The hawk flown at such quarry was naturally
induced to keep high when waiting on. The objection to any
such flight is that the quarry has not a fair chance of shifting
from the stoop when it comes.</p>

<p>The giving of bagged quarry is not a thing to be encouraged
or continued for any length of time. Bagged game never fly
well, seldom passably even; and they demoralise a hawk.
Bagged house-pigeons fly admirably; but then they are not the
quarry you want your hawk to pursue. On the contrary, you
are particularly anxious that as your hawk is waiting on for a
covey to be put up she shall not start off in pursuit of a chance
pigeon. Be very stingy, therefore, with your bagged pigeons;
and if you give any at all, leave off directly your hawk has
begun to mount at all decently.</p>

<p>Eyesses of all kinds are often given to raking away, <i>i.e.</i>
wandering away from the falconer to inordinate distances, when
they ought to be waiting on nearly over his head. And these
aberrations are generally in a down-wind direction. It is fortunate,
therefore, that in game-hawking the quarry is usually
put up by walking down-wind. Otherwise many young hawks
would have little chance of coming up with them. For it is a
curious thing that, as compared with game birds, the speed of
a peregrine is greater when going down-wind, whereas in rook-hawking
she gains more rapidly when both are flying up-wind.
On the troublesome habit of raking away, some observations
will be found in the chapter on &ldquo;Vices.&rdquo; Practice is usually the
best remedy. A hawk generally has gumption enough to see
that by constantly waiting on down-wind she puts herself at a
great disadvantage for killing her bird if it goes up-wind; and
when she has come to understand that the bird is going to be
put up by you, and not accidentally, she will begin to place herself
willingly in such a position over you as to be ready for the
stoop when the birds are flushed. &ldquo;Why-loe!&rdquo;&mdash;a cry with a
rather Chinese sound about it&mdash;was the shout used for calling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">« 120 »</a></span>
in a raking hawk. Of course, while flying her at the lure you
may do something towards habituating your eyess to keep up-wind,
by rewarding her when she stoops from there, and not
from the other side. So also, in actual flying, keep still, and let
the game lie, while she is wide; and move on when she is in
her proper place. If she can get a kill or two from a pitch over
the falconer&rsquo;s head it will be better for her than any number of
kills made when she was waiting on wide.</p>

<p>The glory of a falconer who goes in for game-hawking is
&ldquo;a falcon towering in her pride of place&rdquo;; and her &ldquo;place&rdquo; is
some hundreds of yards above her master&rsquo;s head. A high pitch
is the beauty of a game-hawk. It is what enables her to kill,
and to kill well. The best game-hawks go up until they look
quite small in the sky. A thousand feet is often attained.
When a peregrine is as high as this, it matters comparatively
little whereabouts the game gets up. She can come down upon
them nearly as easily at an angle of 70° or 80°, as at an angle
of 90°. Sometimes even more easily. The time occupied in
coming down is a mere nothing compared with the time which
would be occupied in flying along the level to the same spot.
When once, therefore, you see your hawk at a good pitch, use
every effort to get up the game. When she sees the men
running she will very likely be all the more ready to keep in a
good place. After a week or two&rsquo;s practice she will know well
enough what the whole show means, and will play her part in it
<i>con amore</i>.</p>

<p>If your hawk will not mount properly, but potters about in
a useless way at a mean height, you may try other plans. You
may call her off half a mile or so from the lee side of an open
moor, and, as she comes across it up-wind, let beaters from each
side try to drive grouse inwards towards her line of flight. If
you can once enable her to take a grouse there are hopes of her
yet. You may even fly her from the fist at a grouse if you can
get near enough to one to make it at all likely that she will
catch it. I have seen this done with a backward young falcon,
which would not wait on. There ensued a stern chase all along
the ground for at least half a mile, both birds flying at almost
exactly the same pace. The sight was ridiculous enough; but
in the end the falcon managed to catch the grouse, and was
allowed to take her pleasure on it. The success, small as it
was, saved the hawk at anyrate from being disgusted with
grouse-hawking, as she would otherwise very soon have been.
It is wonderful what good is done to a young hawk by
catching a difficult quarry by her own unaided efforts. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">« 121 »</a></span>
encouragement she derives from it is occasionally so great that
she seems suddenly to develop her latent powers beyond all
expectation.</p>

<p>You must not, however, expect that every young falcon will
be a good grouse-hawk. Indeed, you must not expect many
to be so. The quarry is a difficult one, and until you have
trained a good many partridge-hawks you are not likely to
make one for grouse. In partridge-hawking no very great
speed is wanted, if only the hawk will mount well and throw
up well. Partridges can be flushed much nearer, as a rule, to
the hawk than grouse. Although they are fast, especially up-wind,
they are not as fast as grouse, nor as wild. Nor perhaps,
I may add, as perverse in getting up at the place and time
you like least, though both are clever enough at choosing their
time for making off. In an enclosed country, if you do not kill
your partridge at the first shot, he will often put in at the next
hedge, and there you may mark him and get him out. But on
an open moor the grouse generally go so far before putting in
that you cannot mark the place near enough to get them out
quickly. Thus out of a hundred eyess peregrines, probably
more than 70 per cent. will, in good hands, fly partridges very
fairly, whereas out of a hundred eyess falcons&mdash;leaving tiercels
out of the account&mdash;you will not find anything like fifty which
are really good at the bigger quarry. Of tiercels it would be
rash to say that even 1 per cent. would fly well at grouse. Of
the falcons which fail some appear to be too lazy, and others
too slow. A good deal depends on the first few flights. If a
hawk has good luck on two or three occasions when she is first
taken out, and a young grouse gets up well within reach, the
young hawk will take heart, and, feeling assured that she can
take the quarry, will try hard and will improve. Choose, therefore,
for a hawk that is of doubtful courage the flights which
seem likely to be the easiest. Remember that an immense deal
depends upon the conditions under which you call upon your
hawk to make her first flight at a grouse.</p>

<p>There are still some places where you can shoot grouse over
dogs. If it be your good fortune to have access with your hawks
to a moor where this can be done, you are in luck. As soon as
there is a steady point (you are, of course, on open ground),
unhood and throw off your hawk, which has already learnt to
wait on. As long as she is moving upwards, making each circle
a little higher than the last, stand still and let her go on, or, if
the point is far off, walk steadily towards it. The grouse will
have seen the hawk, and be in no hurry to move while she is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">« 122 »</a></span>
mounting; but presently they will be aware also of your
approach. Then there will be a small debate in their minds&mdash;or
rather in that of their papa&mdash;whether it is best to keep still
and eventually be shot at, or to start off at once and at once
be stooped at. The nearer you approach, and the farther the
hawk rakes away, the more does the decision incline towards
making a bolt of it; but papa grouse is not going to make a
fool of himself by bolting at the moment which you would
prefer. Your programme, of course, is to wait till your falcon
is heading in towards the dog, and then rush in upon the
hesitating assembly. Unfortunately, this plan does not fit in
with the views of the worthies in question. They have also
been waiting till the hawk&rsquo;s head was turned away, and now, as
she is near the outer part of her circle which is farthest from
the quarry, up they get, and off they go, whizzing along the
top of the heather.</p>

<p>At this stage of the proceedings the modern falconer does,
for once, find the use of his voice. He shouts loudly to call the
hawk&rsquo;s attention and to cheer her on. &ldquo;Hey, gar, gar, gar!&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Hoo, ha, ha!&rdquo; are old-fashioned cries for encouraging a
falcon to stoop from her pitch, and are still often used. There
can be no doubt that a shout of some kind, or a blast on the
horn, if you prefer it, has an inspiriting effect on hawks, and that
not only when they start for their first descent, but at each
successive stoop. I almost fancy that I have actually seen
them cheer up as they heard a loud &ldquo;Bravo&rdquo; come from the
field far beneath after a brilliant stoop or a masterly throw-up!
It is with grouse and black-game, more than with any other
quarry, that you see at once when they get up the immense
advantage of a high pitch. When the falcon is some hundreds
of feet high she commands a wide area below. At the height
of a quarter of a mile it matters little whether the range of her
circling flight takes her a hundred yards to one side or the
other. She can come down with equal ease upon any one spot
in an area of thirty acres.</p>

<p>No one knows how the speed and force of a falcon&rsquo;s stoop
are gained. All we can say is that it is the fastest movement
made by any living thing in the world. It is not flying, and it
is not falling, but a combination of the two, with some other
impulse which we do not understand. Mere weight must be at
least a most important element, for a heavy hawk seems always
to come down quicker as well as far more forcibly than one of
the same species which is lighter. But weight is only one factor
in the agglomeration of influences which make the stoop of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">« 123 »</a></span>
peregrine and the ger so swift. It must be seen to be believed
in. There is no conceivable way of measuring its speed, but it
is such that the momentum of it alone carries the hawk with
half-closed wings right past a grouse at his best pace, making
that pace appear absolutely slow by comparison. The descent
from above is often made so that the hawk is at the end of it a
few feet or yards behind the grouse, and nearly on a level with
him. Hence the course of the pursuer bends forwards horizontally,
but with such deviation from the straight line as is
necessary to correspond with the flight of the pursued. It is so
regulated that it may pass through that part of the air where
the quarry is expected to be. Of course the expectation may
be falsified. The hawk may suppose that the grouse will
swerve to the right, whereas he may swerve to the left. But,
just as a fine fencer will divine by some subtle skill whether
his adversary is going to parry in <i>carte</i> or <i>tierce</i>, or to make
a single or double disengagement, so the good game-hawk
judges from some slight movement or attitude where the
grouse intends to be at the moment when she rushes past.
This power is not so surprising in a haggard, but some eyesses
seem to be instinctively gifted with a share of it. Others
acquire it rapidly both in stooping at the lure and in their
actual flights. But with eyesses it is rather the exception to
be really good footers, whereas with haggards and many red
passage hawks it is almost the rule.</p>

<p>Passage peregrines are, of course, much more likely to succeed
with grouse and black-game than eyesses. Out of a dozen
falcons skilfully taken in hand, and kept specially for game-hawking,
it would not be unreasonable to expect that eight or
nine would take their quarry well. By rights a passager which is
intended to be flown principally at game should be captured in
the spring. There is no use in keeping her all the while idle
from November to the next August. If taken in April she would
be well fit for flying on the twelfth of August. There would,
it is true, be some trouble about the moult, but this might often
be deferred till very much later than it can be with eyesses.
According to modern practice, which is to catch no wild
peregrines in spring, the passager has almost always been more
or less flown at rooks in the early part of the year. She has
accordingly to unlearn a good deal that she learnt then, and be
introduced to the much more risky and artificial accomplishment
of waiting on. That she should take kindly to this habit
is not a thing to be anticipated. It would be going rather too
far to expect her to moon about overhead humbly waiting till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">« 124 »</a></span>
the falconer below pleases to throw out for her a morsel of cold
and uninviting food. You will generally find it best to employ
with her rather different tactics from those which served for the
eyesses. Thus you may call her off to the lure from the other
side of a wide moorside, and, as she comes across the heather,
contrive that there shall get up out of it a very fast pigeon.
On the first occasion it is ten to one that she will start at this
from the very moderate height at which she was flying towards
you; but whether she takes the pigeon or not, she will know
very well that she ought, for her own advantage, to have been
higher when he got up; and the next time you call her off at a
similar place and in a similar way, the odds are that she comes
to you higher in the air. A third trial will probably find her
higher still, and you may let her make a circle or two before
starting the pigeon. When she has once flown a grouse in a
somewhat similar way the effect will be still more marked.
Do not now dream of lowering her pitch by ever letting her
stoop to the lure. Indeed, after the passager is once made to
the dead lure, it need scarcely be used at all, except to call the
hawk back after unsuccessful flights.</p>

<p>For the first twelve months you must still be mistrustful of
your passager. Some of the old writers advise not to try her
at waiting on until she is intermewed. But when once she can
be trusted she will do better than almost any eyess. To begin
with, she can kill from a much lower pitch than the latter. She
is swifter on the wing; she is a better footer; and she knows
much better how to play her cards. And one of the best cards
of a game-hawk is a high pitch. Why should she not play it?
Has she not already done so to perfection long before you had
the honour of her acquaintance? How often, in far northern
lands, has she from above the highest mountains come down
like a thunderbolt upon the fast-flying ptarmigan or shifty rock-pigeon?
Does she not know that it is this altitude which gives
power and success? When she has begun killing grouse she
will soon enter into the spirit of the thing. Every bird&mdash;and a
hawk not least&mdash;knows that what has happened once or twice
may happen again. She was thrown off; she saw no lure, no
rook. (For we took care, did we not, that none was in sight?)
After a while you put up a grouse for her. And now, on
another occasion, to the same beginning will there not be
the same end? She will almost certainly think it well to be
prepared for such a contingency; and the only way to be
prepared is to get up a bit, and to remain pretty near the
falconer. As soon as her pains have been rewarded she is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">« 125 »</a></span>
&ldquo;made.&rdquo; The mischief of it is that you cannot, with grouse,
make sure of giving her these fair trials just when you wish.
Grouse are such &ldquo;contrairy&rdquo; birds, that you cannot always
find them when you have the best right to expect that you will.
You must, however, do your best; and I, for one, verily believe
that the hawk knows when you are doing your best. Otherwise,
what is the moral of that pretty story, so well told by
&ldquo;Peregrine,&rdquo; of the falcon which, finding the pointer rather slow
in putting up the covey, made a stoop at him by way of a
gentle hint, and then got up to her pitch again?</p>

<p>Black-game are still more difficult to take than grouse. An
old cock will hardly be taken unless from a good pitch and
under favourable circumstances. Grey-hens, however, have a
way early in the season of sometimes lying very close; and
when this happens, and the hawk happens to be waiting on
near, she will cut the poor wretch down easily. With black-game
the first stoop is generally the most deadly, but it must
be made from a high pitch. A gerfalcon or tiercel stooping at
an old blackcock in a really open place is the perfection of
game-hawking, and from certain points of view&mdash;that of mere
speed, for instance&mdash;the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of all hawking.</p>

<p>Partridges, on the other hand, are easier in all respects&mdash;easier
to find, easier to approach, easier to kill. The <i>modus
operandi</i> is exactly the same as for the larger game. If you
can work with a pointer or setter, so much the better; the
hawk will generally know after a while what the dog means
and where the birds are likely to get up. An old game-hawk
will often display marvellous intelligence in waiting on in the
right position. When this is the case, and the country is good,
the bag fills rapidly. No sooner is there a point than off goes
the hood. After a short delay the hawk is at her pitch, and
you can walk or ride in. Any partridge must be clever which
avoids the first stoop of an old peregrine. Even if he does,
except in a country where there are thick covers, the fatal blow
is merely deferred. Putting in at a thin hedge is only a
temporary escape, for you can mark the place. The hawk will
mark it also, by making her point, <i>i.e.</i> throwing up into the air
over the spot, and she will wait on while you beat. A spaniel
or retriever will generally rout out the fugitive. The orthodox
cry for encouraging the hawk when the game is so routed out
is &ldquo;Howit! howit!&rdquo; Sometimes the partridge which has put
in is, as an old author says, &ldquo;so surcharged with fear&rdquo; as to be
caught by the dog or picked up by the hand. It should then
generally be thrown out for the hawk to take, especially if she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">« 126 »</a></span>
is a young one, and the dog admonished by the cry of &ldquo;Ware,
hawk! ware!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you use no dogs, mark down a bird or a covey, and put
your hawk on the wing to windward of the place, then, as she
waits on, walk or ride down-wind towards the spot. If the
hawk flies wide make a halt till she is coming up, and then go
on at full speed again. As long as she is facing the birds, and
not down-wind of them, you have a good chance of a kill.
When you are quite sure that there are birds on a ground you
need not wait to mark any down, but beat the ground down-wind,
keeping the men in line, with the hawk in the air. When
the birds are wild this is often the only way in which you can
get a flight. The worst of it is that the first bird which gets up
may get up a quarter of a mile ahead, though there are plenty
of nearer ones on the ground. Of course the hawk will go at
the first which gets up, and there will be a long stern chase,
with small chance of a kill, and perhaps a long delay before
the hawk is got back. If you have to go down-wind after her&mdash;which
ought not to be the case, but often is&mdash;you must make
a dead beat in coming back so as to get up-wind again, and
begin afresh to drive to leeward.</p>

<p>Such, as far as the aërial part of it is concerned, is game-hawking.
A much more complicated affair than rook-hawking,
as the hawk has to be trusted all alone to mount to her pitch,
and stay there sometimes for many minutes without raking
away, and, above all, without checking at other quarry. The
hawk, moreover, is not the only actor in the play. You must
arrange your beaters and markers properly, even for partridge-hawking,
and much more for moor-game. If you intend to
hawk over dogs, which you should certainly do if you have the
chance, the hawk, while being manned and entered, must be
induced to make friends with them and they with her. In the
nature of things a hawk mistrusts a dog, even if she does not
actively dislike him, and you must get rid of this mistrust.
Your pointer or setter, and your retriever too, or whatever dog
you intend to use for any purpose, must often be present while
her ladyship is being fed and carried. First, of course, at a
respectful distance, but by degrees nearer and nearer, until the
pair of them are on quite good terms with one another. A few
raps over the nose will teach Ponto not to be too familiar; and
a nice wing of chicken offered to Stella within a foot of that
same nose will do wonders in reconciling her to its proximity.
A long step will have been gained when you can let the dogs
play about on the lawn while the hawks sit still on their blocks,
watching with contemptuous eye movements which are clownish
and undignified as compared with their own in the air. But
the real triumph will come when they have all been out for a
day together; when, with Ponto standing at the point, Stella
has glittered high above him in the sunshine, circling gracefully
with expectant eye turned down; when Ponto, down-charging
humbly, has seen the lightning-like stoop a hundred
yards ahead; when the partridge, shifting cleverly, has put in
to a hedge; and when Pompey the retriever, tugging at his
leash, has been led up to the spot and has enjoyed the felicity
of putting out that same partridge for Stella to finish off with
another dash from the sky. Then it will be a pretty sight, if
you have time to enjoy it, to see the hawk, with the pride of
victory in her eyes, pluming the dead quarry on the ground,
while the two dogs, stretched at length close by, look on
contentedly, conscious that part of the credit for the whole
performance is due to them.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">« 127 »</a></span></p>

<p>Even if there are no dogs, the falconer must have a watchful
eye on his company in the field, especially if it includes new
hands at the now unfashionable sport. These must be warned
mildly, or it may be reminded sharply, to maintain that repose
of demeanour which befits the sport of kings. To keep still as
the falcon mounts is quite as essential as to press on when she
has got to her pitch. If a kill occurs it is lawful enough to
join in the death-cry, but not to hurry up. Such ill-timed zeal
might cause an infinity of mischief, and even, in the case of
a falcon or ger, the loss of her then and there. Everyone
present should stop fifty or more yards from the fatal spot,
except the one man who is authorised to take her up; and while
he makes in, no noise or violent movement should disturb the
solemn scene. Cigars may be lighted, and the incidents of the
flight may be discussed; but it is only when the falconer, rising
from his knees with the victor on his glove, gives the signal to
come on, that curiosity may be gratified by a good look at
the vanquished.</p>

<p>There is some variety in the mode employed by hawks in
taking game. In rook-hawking they all &ldquo;bind&rdquo; to the quarry,
that is, they clutch it in the air, and retain their hold as they
come down to earth. I think I am right in saying that when a
hawk strikes and does not hold a rook, it is almost always
either accidentally or because her talon has not held fast.
Many peregrines&mdash;perhaps all eyesses&mdash;begin by binding to
grouse and partridges. But the tremendous speed of the
stoop in game-hawking often carries the stooper so fast up to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">« 128 »</a></span>
her quarry, and onwards after it is struck, that the talon will
not hold. Something in the body of the victim gives way&mdash;the
skin, or maybe a bone or two. Moreover, the strain upon a
falcon&rsquo;s foot, if she dragged along with her a heavy bird flying
only half as fast at the moment as herself, might be painful
and even dangerous. Consequently a hawk which has a very
&ldquo;hard&rdquo; stoop, as all passage gers have and many wild-caught
peregrines, will sometimes not endeavour to catch hold or bind.
They then &ldquo;strike&rdquo; in the truest sense of the word. They deal
a blow, either downwards or forwards, using the two hind talons
for it, and either break some bone or knock all the wind out of
the victim struck. The jar of the blow as they rush by tells
them that it has come home, and instead of throwing up high,
as they would if they had missed, they check their flight
quickly, and, swinging round in the air, descend rapidly on
the panting or dazed foe. Instances have been known when a
stoop has cut the head clean off from a grouse, and one of
Mr. Freeman&rsquo;s falcons cut through several ribs of a partridge
as she hit it down. And yet the ger&rsquo;s stoop is accounted much
&ldquo;harder&rdquo; than the peregrine&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Game-peregrines, when well entered, may very well be flown
four or five times a day. Some of them, when in good fettle,
more. Six kills in one day is a decided feat for a peregrine;
though it has been accomplished in modern times, and probably
surpassed occasionally. But it is unwise to overdo the thing,
and so tax the hawk too severely. If you have a very high-mounter,
you may as well remember a piece of advice upon
which D&rsquo;Arcussia insists. This is to fly her not many times in
any one day. Her high mounting is such a grand thing in itself,
he says, that it is better to maintain it, even if your bag and
your score suffer, than by letting her kill more&mdash;which she
could undoubtedly do&mdash;to run the risk of lowering her pitch.
If, however, a hawk has had bad luck, and still seems &ldquo;full of
flying,&rdquo; you may go on after several unsuccessful flights in the
hope of rewarding her at last. It is a very good thing in all
sorts of hawking to &ldquo;leave off with a kill.&rdquo; Accordingly, if
the third or fourth flight is successful, the wise falconer will
often feed up and leave well alone. I should like to go a little
further, and say that at any time after a very hard flight, in
which the hawk has triumphed over exceptional difficulties
and greatly exerted herself, it is a wise thing to feed up. &ldquo;Oh,
do fly her again,&rdquo; is a seductive cry which some friend is likely
to raise. But though next time she could not fly better, she
might perhaps fly worse. I should be inclined to tell such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">« 129 »</a></span>
enthusiastic friend that I would wait until the morrow. I would
let that hawk go to rest with the memory of that one big flight
in her mind. It will be a pleasant memory, embittered by no
thought of subsequent failure. One really severe flight, after a
good bout of waiting on, is a fair day&rsquo;s work for any long-winged
hawk, unless she is owned by a mere pot-hunter. It
may be the first flight of the day, or it may be the fifth&mdash;perhaps
the sixth or seventh; but I think it will be well to finish up
with it.</p>

<p>I am glad to be able to give here some actual records of the
performances of game-hawks, which have been most kindly
given me by Mr. St. Quintin, whose skill in this department of
falconry, as in many others, is second to none.</p>

<p>In the season of 1882 Mr. St. Quintin and Colonel Brooksbank,
on a moor which they took in Sutherland, took with the
hawks 200 grouse, besides three blue hares, killed by the eyess
Parachute, and one wild duck. After returning to England,
Parachute killed no less than seventy-six partridges, besides five
pheasants.</p>

<p>On the same moor, in 1884, the same gentlemen killed in
one day (August 18) five grouse, four black-game (greyhens and
young blackcock), and a hoodie crow; and on another day
(August 20) eleven grouse.</p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Lark-Hawking</span></p>


<p>The merlin, the lady&rsquo;s hawk, has always been the hawk
<i>par excellence</i> for larks. Hobbies, no doubt, have taken
them in the old days, though they were used more often for
&ldquo;daring&rdquo; them by waiting on above, which so terrified the larks
that they could be picked up by hand. They take them now
constantly in the wild state. But when reclaimed, they have for
many years past proved complete failures in the hands of our
modern amateurs. The late Lord Lilford made several attempts
to get work out of them, but with hardly any success. Mr.
George Symonds obtained a large number when he was in Italy,
but out of the whole lot could only get one to fly wild quarry.
The writer has twice attempted to train a male hobby for larks,
and on the second occasion enjoyed the advantage of valuable
assistance and advice from Colonel Sanford, who was at the same
time training a brother of the same bird. Great pains were taken
with both of these hawks, which were in perfect plumage and
condition, and had been well hacked by no less able a falconer
than Mr. Newall. They were well broken to the lure, and
thought nothing of waiting on for a quarter of an hour or more
at a vast height. Yet it was found impossible to induce either
of them to make any serious attempts at a flight. I started
mine on one occasion at least twenty times at various small
birds, sometimes putting them up underneath the hawk as he
was waiting on, and at other times throwing him from the fist
at them. These were skylarks, woodlarks, pipits, and other
small frequenters of the turnip-fields. When they were put up
under the hobby, he seldom took the smallest notice. When
thrown off at one, he would generally make a show of pursuing,
but give up before he had gone fifty yards. One lark put in
in front of him to a small heap of hurdles. But instead of
being &ldquo;surcharged with fear,&rdquo; and allowing himself to be picked
up, he seemed to have as much contempt for his pursuer as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">« 131 »</a></span>
latter deserved, and went up briskly again before there was
any chance of even trying to pick him up.</p>

<p>The other hobby, which I trained some years before, did a
little better. He once made two or three rings after a wild
lark. The rings were very pretty, and the style of flying most
correct. But there was one thing wanting, the pace was
insufficient. To tell the truth, it was poor; and at the risk of
being denounced by all ornithologists and most falconers, I
venture to express a doubt whether the hobby is really a fast
hawk. To support the common theory that he is exceptionally
fast we have, no doubt, the fact that he kills swallows and
swifts. But then he has the advantage of them, owing to his
habit of constant soaring at a great height. From this vantage-point,
if he killed one swallow out of a hundred aimed at, it
would not be a conclusive proof of any great speed in flying.
Much more difficult to explain are the passages in Latham and
other old writers to the effect that hobbies, and especially
female hobbies, have &ldquo;plenty of courage,&rdquo; and will well repay
the trouble of training. Blome, in the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Recreation</i>
(1636), is especially loud in his praises of this hawk. After
declaring that she is very amiable, bold, and daring, and will
make a hawk of great delight, he adds that she may be left out
in the field after being fed up, and will come back home to the
place where she was hacked (except at migration times); and
ends up by affirming that she is &ldquo;in all respects, according to
her capacity, as bold and hardy as any other hawk whatsoever.&rdquo;
Either the training of them has become a lost art, or the hobby
has changed his nature entirely since he was thus eulogised.</p>

<p>Very different is the account to be rendered of the merlin,
so inferior in external appearance, so vastly superior in courage
and energy. This, the smallest of the true falcons, has not yet
been persecuted out of existence in England with gun and
snare, though the days of its disappearance are doubtless not
far distant. Of this little hawk I speak perhaps with undue
enthusiasm, having made them an object of special care. But
the merlin has had admirers amongst some very illustrious
persons. Louis <span class="smcap">XIII.</span> kept hundreds of big hawks. He could
have a good day&rsquo;s hawking whenever he liked at cranes, kites,
or herons. Yet he did not disdain, amidst all these temptations,
to devote a whole morning to lark-hawking with merlins, and
was overjoyed at killing one lark with a cast of them. It is true
that this was a winter lark, but it was only a lark for a&rsquo; that!
One of the greatest falconers that modern times have produced,
Mr. E. C. Newcome, declared that after heron-hawking, already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">« 132 »</a></span>
extinct in England in his day, the flight with the merlin at
larks excelled all others in this country. Catherine <span class="smcap">II.</span> of
Russia was also an ardent admirer of this diminutive squire
of dames.</p>

<p>The training and entering of the merlin, eyess or wild-caught,
differs in no important particular from that of the
peregrine which is to be flown at rooks. Only the reclamation
is much more speedily effected. Often it can be completed,
even in the case of an adult jack, in less than a fortnight&mdash;with
the exercise of diligence, of course. An eyess, well hacked, can
be manned in less than a week. This, however, does not mean
that they can be trained to larks in that time. Writers on
falconry sometimes inadvertently lead their readers astray by
declaring that the merlin is easily trained. What the writer means
is probably that they are easily manned and made to the lure.
This is so; but the preparation for flying in the field, at least at
larks, is quite a different matter. Merlins, like all other hawks,
differ greatly in temperament. Occasionally you will find a
whole nest of them quite free from vice. Such hawks are all
easily trained for the field. But more often these little creatures
are imbued from the first with a disposition to carry. And to
fly a merlin at larks before she is cured of this weakness is
to involve yourself in endless trouble. Eyesses are as bad
as haggards&mdash;often worse. Consequently, when the hawk is
manned and made to the lure, more than half your work
is still before you. A non-carrying merlin can be trained in
less than a week after being taken up from hack, whereas
a determined carrier will hardly be safe to fly in double that
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">« 133 »</a></span></p>

<p>There is another respect in which doubts may be entertained
as to the truth of the opinion that merlins are easy to train.
If by training is meant merely the qualifying them for driving
moulting larks into covert, and killing them there, the saying is
true enough. You may go to an enclosed country full of
moulting larks. You may put one up and start the hawk.
The lark, after a short flight, will go into a hedge; and there, if
the merlin does not take him herself, you can either pick him
up with the hand or drive him out for the hawk, which has
taken perch on the fence; and he will be counted in the bag.
But if by training you mean making the hawk fit to take
ringing larks in open ground, the case is different. To do this
a merlin must be in the pink of condition&mdash;quick, long-winded,
persevering, and a good footer. How will you make her so?
She will not wait on; no exercise is to be got that way to bring
her into condition. If an eyess, she has had no practice at
footing. How is she to learn that art? Then the dieting is a
matter of extreme delicacy. If you give butcher&rsquo;s meat, she
will become dull and heavy; pigeon&rsquo;s flesh will give her a
sort of fever; in sheep&rsquo;s heart, the food which most amateurs
recommend, there is but poor nourishment; and she must be
strong enough to go up half a mile, if required! Again, how
are you to measure out the exact quantity that is good for her?
If you give a peregrine or a goshawk an ounce too much or too
little, the mischief done is slight. But give even half an ounce
too much or too little to a jack-merlin, and he is straightway
wrong in his condition. A big hawk is fed only once a day;
there are about twenty-four hours on an average between each
meal. If you fly the big hawk on a fast of twenty-two hours
or of twenty-six, it matters little. But between the feeding-times
of a merlin there is only an average of twelve hours.
Therefore it matters a good deal whether you fly her early or
late. She may be either too hungry or not hungry enough to
do herself full justice.</p>

<p>The trainer who aspires to make a good score with ringing
larks, and not to be content with mere hedge-row pot-hunting,
must work pretty hard. He must not make many mistakes.
He must observe very strictly the instructions already given for
guarding against the besetting vice of carrying, never allowing
a piece of food to be negligently fastened to the lure, or giving
any bagged quarry that can be taken into a tree. He must
find freshly-killed small birds almost daily for every merlin, so
that her digestion and strength may be unimpaired. And in
order to keep his hawk in wind, he must give her plenty of
exercise. He can hardly do this without stooping her often to
the lure. Ten minutes of this work, if the hawk is going all the
time at her best pace, means a good many miles flying. Then
the merlin must be taught to look principally to the fist for
food. When feeding on the lure, whether it is garnished with a
newly-killed sparrow or with a tiring, she must be provided with
tit-bits from the hand, until, instead of fearing the approach of
the falconer, she looks for it with pleasure. She must constantly
be called to the fist. If there is a good-sized spare room available,
she may be exercised there in coming often from one side
of the room to your fist at the other. Some falconers advise
keeping merlins loose in an empty room, where blocks and
perches have been placed; and this is, no doubt, a very good
plan when you have or can build for yourself the right kind of
room. The sort of place recommended later on for moulting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">« 134 »</a></span>
purposes will sometimes do well enough. I have found that
the roof or ceiling is the great difficulty, as the hawks, constantly
flying round just underneath, rub off the outer web of the long
flight feathers. Of course the windows must be guarded with
vertical bars, upon which the little hawks can find no foothold.</p>

<p>For the worst cases of carrying I must refer the reader to the
chapter on &ldquo;Vices.&rdquo; But even with a well-behaved merlin the
trainer must be constantly on his guard, at least for a fortnight
after the hawk has begun work in the field. He must beware,
when she has killed, of shepherds&rsquo; dogs, of wandering crows or
rooks, and of the fowls which are now often found colonising
the open fields, far away from a village or farmhouse. All or
any of these may attack the hawk, and by inducing her to carry
away the lark, sow the seeds of the vile habit. &ldquo;Once a carrier,
always a carrier,&rdquo; is not an entirely true maxim, but it is not far
from the truth. I have known merlins carry badly, and afterwards
abandon the practice; but such cases are not common,
and the trouble involved in effecting the cure is sometimes more
than the merlin is worth. Prevention is many miles better than
cure; good, honest miles, too, measured over the stony hillsides
of Wilts! As you approach your merlin on the ground,
remember not to stare at her, and to give her plenty of time.
On the first few occasions you must exercise the patience of a
veritable Job. She is now, after her victory, more apprehensive
than ever that her hard-earned meal may be ravished from her.
As you walk about, pretending to look at anything rather than
her, she is all the time wondering whether your intentions are
honourable or the reverse. Instinct tells her that they are base.
Her previous experience, on the other hand, is reassuring to her.
Your attitude, as you stroll about, is indicative of no sinister
design. &ldquo;When in doubt do nothing,&rdquo; is a hawk&rsquo;s maxim, as
well as a diplomatist&rsquo;s. Meanwhile there is the quarry to be
plumed. So with many lookings round, and many pauses, and
with a rather misdoubting mind, she falls to at the work of
picking off the feathers. Not greedily&mdash;unless she is a greedy
hawk, or too thin&mdash;but with a provoking deliberation, and with
intervals that seem interminable. At last the feathers are off;
and the warm food&mdash;the best she has ever had&mdash;begins to
engross more of her real attention. Now she is ten times easier
to approach. If, thinks she, you had been going to claim the
quarry for yourself, surely you would have interfered before this.
When she is fairly busy, you may by degrees get nearer, but
keeping a keen look-out, and on the least show of alarm retreating
quietly, but quickly. At length you will be able to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">« 135 »</a></span>
your hand, well garnished with a tempting morsel, within reach
of her.</p>

<p>With a troublesome merlin you may employ, if you are sure
of not bungling it, a very admirable device. You may resort to
what may be called the &ldquo;fishing-rod trick.&rdquo; You will take with
you into the field two joints of a fishing-rod, not including the
top joint. On the thin end of the thinner of these joints, which
must be stiff and stout, you will have fitted a brass hook or
tooth, with its sharp point standing out an inch or so at right
angles from the rod. This apparatus is sometimes invaluable.
You may use one or both joints, as you find you can get nearer
or less near. When you begin to be afraid to go any nearer,
slide the thin end of the rod along the ground as you kneel
until it is quite close to the dead quarry. If your hawk has
had any decent manning at all, she will not be alarmed at it,
even if she notices its stealthy approach. Having got the
point on the lark&rsquo;s body, steering clear of the hawk&rsquo;s feet,
turn the point downwards on it, and firmly but gently press it
down and in. If you bungle, and the point slips, you are probably
done; but if it holds you are safe. Proceed then with
your making in, just as if there was no rod in the case. Always
endeavour to take up the hawk with the hand alone, retaining
your hold by the rod only as a last resort, in case of mischief.
Each time that you can take her up without any trouble occurring,
the easier the job will become. And even an attempt to
bolt, which your firm hold with the rod renders unsuccessful,
will tend to convince the evil-doer of the futility of her proceeding.
Beware particularly of making in if a bagged lark is the
victim. With bagged larks, easily taken, hawks are always
inclined to bolt. On the other hand, if the lark has flown well,
and the hawk is winded, there is less to fear.</p>

<p>When you have taken up your hawk, if you intend to fly her
again, contrive that the body of the lark is held in the palm of
your hand, and the neck alone protrudes between the forefinger
and the base of the thumb. Then, when the brain has been
eaten, and you have thrown away the beak and as much of the
rest of the head as you conveniently can, let her think, or try to
think, that there is no more to be had. If, on the other hand, you
intend to feed her up, let her eat the rest of the lark, or almost
all, and, as she finishes it, slip on the hood, and let her pull
through the last few mouthfuls. Or, as the remains of the lark
may be too bony to pull through easily, you may substitute a
morsel of sheep&rsquo;s heart, which she can more easily dispose of.
A jack which has had half a lark in the morning, and three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">« 136 »</a></span>
or four heads already in the afternoon, will be generally too
much gorged if allowed to take the whole of his last lark. And
some female merlins may, under like circumstances, be considered
to have had enough before they have quite finished their
lark. I have generally found that about a three-quarter crop in
the evening is as much as it is wise to give.</p>

<p>Larks should always be flown up-wind; that is to say, when
they get up to windward, and not to leeward of the hawk. A
down-wind slip is very seldom satisfactory. If the lark is
good you see nothing of the flight, and are dependent on your
markers for finding the hawk, if she kills. The time lost is also
often regrettable. It is not likely that with the first lark flown
by any trained merlin you will have a kill. Only twice, I think,
do I remember such a thing to have occurred. But the escape
of several larks at first will do you no manner of harm. Even
if your merlin refuses, you need not be at all discouraged. One
of the most deadly merlins I ever had, when first taken out,
refused seven larks in succession, and did not kill till her twelfth
flight. But after that first kill she never refused again. If a
trained hawk persists in refusing, or leaving the good larks, in
hopes of getting a bad one, the case is serious. Possibly the
reason may be that she is out of condition. But if it is her
pluck that is wanting, you cannot expect to make much of her.
In any case physic her, and give her two days&rsquo; rest. And the
next time, if you can, fly her in company with a better merlin.
If you should lose such a hawk for three or four days, and then
take her up again, you may take her up cured. But you may
take her up confirmed in her bad habit. When I took up Ruy
Lopez, after three days out in a gale, he would not fly any but
bad larks.</p>

<p>If, in the early days, your merlin puts in a lark, mark the place
very exactly with your eye. You must consider whether you will
drive him out for her or not. If the place is a thick hedge or
big bush, I should be inclined not to attempt it. But if it is a
place where you have a good chance of a second flight, as under
the side of an isolated rick, or under a hurdle where there are
no sheep, I should gratify the hawk by assisting her in the
moment of need, when you can be so useful to her. If you can
see the lark crouching and hiding himself, do not pick him up
with the hand, but drive him out with your foot or the end of
your rod. And do so when the hawk, from the top of the
hurdle, or rick, or wherever she has taken perch, is looking the
right way. A kill on such occasions will encourage her to wait
on another occasion till you can help her in the same way. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">« 137 »</a></span>
form shown by a lark that has been put in and routed out is
generally not so good as before he put in. But there are many
exceptions. A lark got up in the open down before Eva, probably
the best hawk I ever had. But before she could get to
him, he fell without a blow, right in the open. Eva was then
young, and rather fat, and wanted a hard flight, so I was in two
minds whether I would not leave this weak-spirited lark, and go
on and find a better one. Either the lark got up of his own
accord before I had decided, or else I resolved to fly him; anyhow,
when he started for the second time he went right up into
the sky. There was a ringing flight of immense height; and
after a great many stoops the lark was bested, and came down
into a field where there were stooks of wheat. Eva sat on the
top of a stook with her mouth open; the lark underneath, doubtless
in no better plight. I might have walked miles and not
found a lark which afforded me so much sport, and the hawk
such a lung-opener.</p>

<p>The first time your merlin puts in a lark, do not take her on
your fist, unless she goes away from the spot. Let her take
perch close at hand. Be very careful indeed to drive out the
fugitive towards her, so that she sees it go away. By this means
she will see that there is no deception; that it is really the same
lark; and that you have done her the service to rout it out.
But on subsequent occasions it is best always to call the hawk
to the fist before you put up the quarry. Otherwise he may
very possibly go off when she is not looking, especially if the
hawk is on the ground, as she will be if the lark has put in to a
tuft of grass, or in clover, or, as they will when hard pressed, in
stubbles. <i>À propos</i> of putting in, remember always that the
country for lark-hawking must be, if you are to have good
flights, even more open than that necessary for rooks. It requires
so small a shelter to conceal a lark. Even the high grass which
often fringes a road across the downs, a patch of nettles or
thistles, an old stone wall, or a waggon, will tempt a faint-hearted
ringer to come down. He comes down to almost certain death;
for the man is there, in alliance with the hawk. But the ringing
flight is spoilt; and that is what you do not want to occur.
The better the hawk, the more ready the lark is to put in. So
that the mere length of flight does not prove much as to the
excellence either of pursuer or pursued, unless you know from
experience what is the ability of the former.</p>

<p>Larks, for hawking purposes, may be divided into three
kinds. First there is the &ldquo;ground&rdquo; lark&mdash;generally deep in
moult&mdash;who does not mount at all, but makes off as hard as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">« 138 »</a></span>
can fly towards the nearest place where he thinks he can save
himself. These larks are sometimes pretty fast, and take a
good deal of catching, dodging the stoops by shifting to right
or left, and sometimes avoiding a good many. But more often,
especially in an enclosed country, they are wretched creatures,
taken easily by a fast hawk, either in the air or by being driven
into insufficient cover. These are the sort of larks that beginners
are sometimes very proud of killing. The true falconer
detests them as a sad nuisance. It is true that when they are
fast and clever, they improve the hawk&rsquo;s footing powers, and
give her a sharp burst of hard flying. Such a flight serves as a
short gallop at full speed does to a horse in training. But from
the sporting point of view it is objectionable. Fortunately, on
the open down, it is not common.</p>

<p>Secondly, there are the &ldquo;mounting&rdquo; larks, which go up and
try to keep the air. The original ambition of these larks is to
fairly out-fly the hawk, and never let her get above them. But
at moulting-time they can seldom hope to accomplish this if
the hawk is a fast one in really good condition. Sometimes,
going wide of them, and making an upper-cut, she will bind to
them at the first shot. But this is rare. Generally there are
several stoops; and the whole business very accurately resembles
a coursing match. The stoops are made from all sorts of distances,&mdash;short
and long, upwards and downwards, with the wind
and against it. I have seen a stoop by a trained merlin&mdash;a jack,
rather&mdash;which was 300 yds. long, measured along the ground,
to which must be added something for the height. Very often,
when the lark has escaped one stoop by a hair&rsquo;s-breadth, and
feels a conviction that next time he will not escape at all, he
drops headlong towards a place of supposed shelter, with the
hawk close at his heels. The harder he is pressed, the more
indifferent will be the hiding-place with which he is fain to be
content. Before a first-rate hawk he will go to a bare hurdle, a
flat-sided rick, or a tuft of grass, whereas if he has less trouble in
shifting, he will pass over all these attractions, and continue to
throw out the pursuer&mdash;though with exhausting efforts&mdash;till he
can get to a thick hedge or a substantial spinny. With this
kind of lark you may have more flights, more running, and
more excitement with a moderate merlin than with those of
the very first quality. The latter are a bit too good for the
work, and make the flight too short. Strangers who come out
hawking and see a mounting lark so taken, are apt to say:
&ldquo;What a bad lark to be caught so soon!&rdquo; It is often not the
badness of the lark, but the goodness of the hawk, which makes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">« 139 »</a></span>
short work of the flight. The mounting lark would always be a
ringer if the hawk was not fast enough to get above him quickly.</p>

<p>The third sort of lark is the veritable &ldquo;ringer.&rdquo; With the
start he has, he keeps ahead of the hawk, climbing up in spiral
circles. Why not in a straight line? I believe no one can tell
the reason. Possibly he finds that he can get on more pace by
having the wind now in front, now at the back, and between
whiles at the side. The curious thing is that the hawk adopts
the same tactics. The one bird may be circling from right to
left, and the other in the contrary direction. Neither seems
to guide the direction of his rings by any reference to those
which the other is making. It is now a struggle which can get
up the fastest. And it is astonishing to what a height such
flights will sometimes go. Not in a bad country; for there
there will always be cover available after the quarry has gone
up a little way. And he will not be such a fool as to stand the
racket of a shot in the air, when by dropping into a stout hedge
or plantation he can make sure of his escape. As soon as a
lark is 800 ft. high, he can drop, almost like a stone, into
any covert within a radius of 200 yds. from the spot just
under him&mdash;allowance being made, of course, for the effect of
wind. But 800 ft. is not high for a ringing flight. At least
there is nothing at all unusual in it. A lark does not go out of
sight until he is much above that height; and it is no extraordinary
thing for him to do this. I have heard it said that
merlins go up after larks till they are themselves lost to sight.
But it is very seldom that any man is directly below the hawk
at the time when she is highest. I know one case, however,
in which a jack-merlin came right over the markers as
they were running down-wind, more than half a mile from the
start. He must have been very nearly over their heads when
he went up out of their sight. But that hawk was never seen
again. It is, of course, quite possible that such a thing should
occur. But I have never seen any country in England where it
is at all likely. For from such a height&mdash;nearly half a mile
high&mdash;there would always be a safe place into which the quarry
might drop. And if hard pressed, he would do so. When a
lark keeps up as long as this, it is generally because he knows
that he is the better man of the two. And before that time the
hawk will also have found this out.</p>

<p>Larks are in moult from the beginning of August, which is
the earliest time that an eyess merlin can fly, till the middle of
September&mdash;in some years till nearly the end. During this
time, easy ones will mostly be found in the stubbles from which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">« 140 »</a></span>
the corn has just been carried. Stronger and older larks may
be found on the open down, but not in any great numbers. In
years of drought, many will get to the fields where roots are
growing. At these moulting larks, a merlin may be flown six
or eight times in an afternoon. But what was said in the
chapter on &ldquo;Game-Hawking&rdquo; about leaving off with a hard flight
and a kill, is still more applicable to merlins than peregrines.
These little hawks can in addition be flown in the early morning.
But though I have done this occasionally, I doubt its
being a good practice, and should prefer, if the weather is
settled, to give stooping at the lure before breakfast, and wait
till past midday for the field. But when the weather is bad
you must go out when you can. The biggest score that I know
to have been made in a day, flying both morning and evening,
is ten, which Colonel Sanford killed with one of his merlins.
I have myself killed ten in a day with a single hawk; but one
of them was taken by her in a double flight, and therefore
counts only for a half. Each of these hawks was a specially
good-tempered and well-mannered hawk. For any merlin to
take six larks single-handed in one day is a decided feat. The
most I have known to be killed in any one year by a merlin
single-handed is 106, the score of Jubilee in 1897; and the
highest average I have known made is fifty-nine out of sixty-five
flights&mdash;a percentage of more than 90 per cent. This
was achieved by the merlin Sis, which made the extraordinary
score of forty-one out of forty-two successive flights, the one
miss being a ringer at which she was thrown off when the head
of another lark was hardly down her throat&mdash;before she had
shaken herself, or had time to look round.</p>

<p>As soon as the larks have moulted, they become practically
all ringers. Such larks have never yet been taken regularly.
Usually the merlins begin to refuse them in the latter part of
September. The latest lark I have killed was on a 7th of
November. To take winter larks it would be necessary to have
a cast of very first-rate merlins, which had never, upon any
pretext, left a moulting lark. With these it is possible that a
few might be taken; but after very long flights. And what of
the unsuccessful flights? They would go so far that I fear the
hawks must certainly be lost. A merlin which is good enough
to take even one moulted lark is good enough to find her living
anywhere; and I doubt if she would trouble to come back
after a long unsuccessful flight for any reason, sentimental or
otherwise!</p>

<p>Double flights at larks are very pretty, and also very deadly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">« 141 »</a></span>
If you throw off together one merlin which mounts quickly, and
another which is a good footer, you will rarely be beaten during
the moulting season; and when you do meet with a first-rate
ringer, will see as real a bit of sport as man can imagine.
Occasionally you may have a double flight without intending
to do so. Eva had made two stoops at a very high ringer,
and brought him down some yards, when a wild female merlin
joined in. Stoop for stoop they alternatively played their
strokes, as if they had been trained together. After some
twenty of these alternative shots, the lark was taken, high in
the air. But not until we picked up Eva on the dead lark, half
a mile away, did anyone in the field know whether it was she or
the wild hawk that had made the fatal stoop. In other years I
have had many joint flights in the same way; and on one
occasion two wild merlins joined forces with a trained one, and
the lark ran the gauntlet for quite a long time of the three
chance allies. I confess, however, that there are objections
to the double flight with merlins. It may be from stupidity,
but I have never been able to keep the peace between the
partners. After the take, but before you can possibly get up,
there is a scrimmage on the ground, even if there has not been
a chevy in the air, which is not only undignified, but also most
trying to the temper of the hawk which has footed the lark.
Of course when you do come up you can separate the combatants,
and reward the one which has been worsted in the
squabble. But in the meantime, how much mischief may have
been done to the feathers? In heron-hawking, where two
falcons are always flown, the empty-handed one is taken down
to the pigeon, and, with good management, she accepts the
situation pretty cheerfully. But merlins in high condition are
exceedingly hot-tempered, and often violent. No doubt the
double flight can be accomplished with them by the aid of
patience and tact. Mr. Freeman was able to fly his merlins
well in casts. And it is only with a cast that winter larks
could be attempted. Any falconer who could succeed in taking
them right through the winter would have accomplished a greater
feat than that of which Louis <span class="smcap">XIII.</span> was so proud.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Gulls, Heron, Kite, Duck, etc.</span></p>


<p>The flight at gulls is so similar to that at rooks, although
much more difficult, that I should be tempted to say no
more concerning it, were it not that I have been favoured by Mr.
St. Quintin, who is the great authority on the subject, with some
most interesting details of this sport. There can be no doubt,
I think, that of all flights in which peregrines can now be flown
out of the hood in England, gull-hawking is the best. It requires
a cast of hawks; and these must be of special excellence,
and in the height of condition, if any success is hoped for.
Tiercels may be used as well as falcons; eyesses as well as
passagers; but of course the probabilities of success are less
with the smaller and less-experienced hawks. In the case of
the herring-gull, indeed, the quarry falls so heavily, when taken,
that a small hawk is apt to be badly shaken, and may thus
become disgusted with the whole business.</p>

<p>Of the three kinds of gull, the largest, the herring-gull, is
also the least difficult to take. He makes something of a fight
of it on the ground when taken, and can, of course, bite hard if
the hawk gives him a chance. Next to him in order of difficulty
comes the common gull; and last in order is the black-headed
gull, which will hardly be vanquished except by a cast
of very first-rate hawks, and then on a calm day. All gulls
have a great advantage when the wind is high, and usually
escape, so that it is best not to fly them at such times, for fear
of discouraging the hawk. Peregrines must be entered at
bagged gulls, and fed after a kill on pigeon, or some very
palatable food. It is also very advisable to use a make-hawk
when available. On a very still day it is possible that a single
hawk in good practice might take a common gull at the first
stoop, if she had a good start; but if that failed, the quarry
would most likely escape.</p>

<p>The best idea of gull-hawking will be given from a few
quotations from the diary of Mr. St. Quintin, who considers
it a very good day&rsquo;s work to kill two such quarry. On one
occasion an old tiercel, Destiny (who was flown for no less than
eight seasons), was taken out with a very fast eyess tiercel
called Kismet. Thrown off at a gull &ldquo;on passage,&rdquo; that is to
say, passing on the wing, the hawks rattled off high in pursuit,
when a flock of starlings got up under them, and Destiny,
turning over, picked up one, while Kismet, getting above the
gull, killed him at the first stoop. Later on Kismet was flown
single-handed at a flock of gulls with a long slip, and again
managed to kill with his first stoop. Destiny was also slipped
single at a gull, but, after putting in stoop after stoop for at
least three-quarters of a mile, was fairly beaten, the quarry
apparently reaching the river Derwent. As the party hurried
after him he came back quite flown out, and was, of course, not
flown again that day. These hawks were at the time in first-rate
condition. Another year, Gulliver, a very fast eyess tiercel,
belonging to the Old Hawking Club, was taken out to be flown
with Starlight, who had more experience and was a very high
flier. The gulls were spread along a long furrow, and the two
hawks went for different ones. After Gulliver had fetched his
quarry and put in two stoops, Starlight, leaving his gull, came
to the assistance of the other hawk, and went at the quarry
with a smashing stoop. This, however, the gull avoided; and
a long bout of good stooping followed, the eyess sticking to the
work pluckily, but showing signs of fatigue, while the other
hawk mounted high for a decisive shot. This, however, also
failed, and the gull, showing once more above both hawks,
went off scathless, leaving them both with &ldquo;bellows to mend.&rdquo;
Destiny and Kismet on another occasion were thrown off together
at a mixed flock of gulls. They again divided, Kismet
singling out a very large but immature herring-gull, which he
hit hard several times, and finally brought down almost on
his owner&rsquo;s head, while Destiny took after a common gull, and
killed him three-quarters of a mile down-wind. In the winter
of 1889-90 Mr. St. Quintin was so successful as to take forty-three
gulls in seventy-seven flights.</p>

<p>Heron-hawking is a subject which, as far as England is concerned,
belongs rather to history than to practical falconry. A
great deal of nonsense, as well as a good deal of truth, has been
written about it, but those who feel interested must be referred
to the excellent account given in the work, already referred to,
by Schlegel and Wulverhorst, of the proceedings of the Loo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">« 144 »</a></span>
Club in Holland.<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I have talked with Mr. Adrian Möllen, the
falconer of that club, and heard from him that the sport differed
in no respect from rook-hawking, except that the heron was
always flown &ldquo;on passage,&rdquo; when already high in the air, and
that two passage falcons were flown together. He told me
that he had very seldom found any real difficulty in entering a
passage falcon, and never lost one of his own training by any
accident except once, when the mischief arose in a strange way.
The hawks were mounting, when the heron disgorged a good-sized
fish. At this one of his falcons stooped as it fell, took it,
and made off to an inaccessible place, where she devoured
almost the whole of it, and afterwards died of indigestion. In
India heron-hawking is still practised, but there is not the same
enthusiasm about it as there was in Europe some centuries ago,
or in the days of the Loo Club.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_3" id="Footnote_1_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> This famous society was started by the Duke of Leeds and Mr. Newcome, with
the assistance of the Dutch falconer Bots, and had as its president Prince Alexander
of the Netherlands. In 1843, with forty falcons it took about two hundred
herons, almost all of which were released with rings round their legs.</p>
</div>

<p>A much more favourite and exciting sport in India and
other parts of Asia is the flight at kites. In England the fork-tailed
kite was flown from very early times, and it is not a
century ago since one afforded a flight six miles in length in
the Eastern Counties. For this very fine flier gers were commonly
used in the Middle Ages; and the kite was enticed
within range by turning out an owl with a fox&rsquo;s brush tied to its
feet. In India the Brahminy kite and the brown kite are both
very common, and are taken with sakers, as well as peregrines,
and occasionally by shaheens. I hear that eyess sakers are
preferred, and that they are never allowed to fly any other
quarry until they are slipped first at bagged kites. It is also
necessary to make sure that the hawk shall never taste the flesh
of the kite when taken; as if once this has occurred the saker is
useless ever afterwards for this quarry. It appears, however,
that not many sakers are good enough to take the kite, even
when physicked and flown two together; and when they have
been made to it they command a very high price.</p>

<p>We must also now go to foreign countries, and especially to
India, to see duck-hawking, which was formerly so favourite a
sport in the British Islands. Duck are not now plentiful enough
in England to induce one to keep a hawk for them alone,
although occasionally one is taken by a game-hawk during the
season. Hawking &ldquo;at the brook,&rdquo; as it was called, was conducted
on very much the same principles as game-hawking in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">« 145 »</a></span>
our own times. The hawk was thrown off and waited on at
a high pitch, while the duck were put up by water-spaniels
working in the water in concert with beaters on the bank.
Much pains were taken to drive the quarry in the right direction.
The first stoop would of course be the most dangerous to
the rising duck, and if he avoided this, there would often be
a fine chase, as the duck, when once fairly on the wing, is very
swift, and severely taxes the powers of the best peregrine. Peregrines
are very keen after this quarry, and indeed in some
countries are commonly known by the local name of &ldquo;duck-hawks.&rdquo;
In India the peregrine and the shaheens are both used
for this flight, which is highly esteemed, and, no doubt, quite
as good as grouse-hawking. It is certain that it was also a
favourite sport in China and Japan, where it may still be had
by any adventurous sportsman who travels so far.</p>

<p>A very lively and amusing flight is that at the magpie,
which was largely practised in Ireland until the middle of the
nineteenth century, and is still occasionally to be seen. It
partakes of the two characters of sport described in Chapters
<a href="#CHAPTER_VII"><span class="smcap">VII.</span></a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII"><span class="smcap">VIII.</span></a> In fact, just as the magpie is a parti-coloured
bird, neither all black nor all white, so the pursuit of him is
neither wholly by flying from the fist nor wholly from the pitch,
but by a combination of the two. The magpie is seldom to be
found in very open country. You must therefore get at him as
you best can. A cast of hawks is flown; and often it is an
even chance that their wide-awake quarry will get off to some
shelter before either hawk has even had one shot at him.
Then both hawks will wait on, when they have become <i>au fait</i>
at the game, so as best to cut off his retreat to another covert.
The falconer meanwhile has to use his best exertions to dislodge
the fugitive from his place of rest. He should be assisted
by a large field, which must hurry up with all speed to the
spot, and by every imaginable device endeavour to rout out the
quarry. Sticks and stones are discharged. Hunting-whips
are cracked. Pistol-shots are even brought into requisition,
and boys are deputed to climb the trees. The tiercels&mdash;for
tiercels are most commonly used for this flight&mdash;wait on
knowingly in advantageous places,&mdash;one sometimes close to the
covert, ready for a sharp, quick stoop; and the other at a
higher pitch, hoping for a long shot. The magpie is not a fast
flier; but he uses his head as well as his wings, and is ready
whenever a chance occurs to get back to covert. The beaters
have often more to do than the hawks, with shouting, running,
pelting, and contriving by their joint efforts to make the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">« 146 »</a></span>
fugitive take to the open, where one of the hawks can get a
fair shot at him. But the latter must be staunch at waiting on,
good footers, and quick to take advantage of the efforts made
by their friends below. There is not much in this business of
what may be called the nobility of the noble sport,&mdash;none of
the long dashing stoops out of the clouds which you see in
grouse-hawking, or of the laborious mounting and ringing which
you had with the gull or rook. It rather resembles the hedge-row
driving described later on in the chapter on Sparrow-Hawks.
But for those who like bustle and excitement, and hard exercise
for the legs and voice, few things will beat magpie-hawking.
And few things will demonstrate more clearly the marvellous
adaptability of the peregrine to the exigencies of the case. A
wild hawk would have no chance with a magpie, unless he
caught him unawares, crossing from one bush or plantation to
another. But the trained hawk, knowing that the men are
working with him, joins his efforts with a good will to theirs,
and does exactly that which you want him to do, and which
it is best for him to do. As an example of co-operation
between man and hawk, a magpie-worry is not to be excelled.
Neither of the actors in the scene is any good without the
other; and if either fails to do the right thing at the right
moment, the whole play is spoiled, and both players disgusted.
Tiercels, well assisted, and well worked at their quarry, make
very good bags. Mr. St. Quintin and Colonel Brooksbank,
with two tiercels, Meteor and Buccaneer, killed forty-five in one
campaign; and several other capital scores have been made
within recent years.</p>

<p>The green plover is such a common bird, and so easily
found in open ground, that it is a pity, in one sense, that he
cannot be flown. The unlearned may ask, Why not? The
answer is, Because no hawk is good enough to take him. By
which I do not mean that no peewit is ever taken by a peregrine.
The wild peregrines take them not unfrequently; and
trained ones have now and then succeeded in cutting one down.
But the attempt to make trained hawks take them regularly,
or even fly them for any length of time, has always failed.
John Barr, amongst others, trained some picked tiercels
specially for this quarry. When I saw him some time after he
had made this experiment, he assured me that to kill peewits
with trained hawks was impossible. Of course plovers of all
kinds are not more exempt than other creatures from the ills
that flesh is heir to. In fact, to judge from the tone of their
cry, and considering the way they have of sitting in wet feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">« 147 »</a></span>
without changing their stockings, it may be supposed that they
are often out of sorts. Sometimes, doubtless, like other birds,
they are infirm and old. When labouring under any such disadvantage,
even if it be only rheumatism or a cold in the head,
a chance peewit may be cut off and reckoned in the hawk&rsquo;s
score. Otherwise these birds are too clever for even the best
trained hawks. I have seen even bagged peewits make such a
complete fool of a falcon that she was ashamed of herself. They
did not exactly &ldquo;fly round&rdquo; the hawk, as the saying is, but
they did almost as much. They made rings underneath her as
she was ringing up, keeping in exactly that position where she
could never get her head towards them at all. Then if the
hawk did manage to put in a stoop they would face about so as
to avoid the shot, and, with a great flop of one wing, start away
like phantoms in an unexpected direction. If the hawk contrived
to get at them from behind, they would take a sort of
header downwards, and, making a kind of somersault in the
air, come up behind the hawk with a manifest smile on their
usually daft countenances.</p>

<p>On the downs in Wilts and Berks you will sometimes see a
rook-hawk, or, for that matter, a game-hawk, when coming back
from an unsuccessful flight, make a dash at a lapwing as he
flounders about below. But the creature generally shifts from
the stoop with almost contemptuous ease. Only in rare cases
is he too slow. Mr. E. C. Pinckney once took a lapwing with
a very young eyess tiercel; that is, the hawk put him in after a
good flight, and he was picked up. But I do not think that
tiercel ever took another. There is therefore a chance for anyone
who wants to beat the record in the matter of plover-hawking.
With two very first-rate passage tiercels, or perhaps,
better still, two shaheens, the attempt might be made again.
Whoever succeeded would thereby have carved for himself a
prominent niche in the falconer&rsquo;s temple of fame.</p>

<p>The Norfolk plover may be taken with a falcon or tiercel,
generally without great difficulty. Golden plovers would, I
think, always escape, unless they could be put up just under a
hawk waiting on. Curlews and several of the common sea-fowl
might also be taken, if found at a sufficient distance from the
sea. The wild goose was formerly flown with success in England
by gers. Landrails, if they can be got to rise, will, of
course, fall an easy prey, and quail can also be taken, though
the sparrow-hawk or the merlin is the right hawk for them.
They are fast, but do not shift well. The jackdaw is faster
than the rook, and a better shifter. He is sometimes killed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">« 148 »</a></span>
a rook-hawk, and may afford a very good flight. Pheasants, of
course, will be caught by a falcon when they get up in open
ground. Colonel Sanford knocked down a full-grown pheasant
with a tiercel; but the little hawk could not hold him on the
ground.</p>

<p>Woodcocks have been flown with a great deal of success
in comparatively recent times, and have shown very excellent
sport, requiring quite a first-rate peregrine to take them well,
and that usually after a long and often high flight. Between
1823 and 1833 Mr. John Sinclair flew woodcocks regularly in
Scotland, and captured in one season as many as fifty-seven
with a falcon. Before this the Renfrewshire Subscription Club
did good execution with the quarry, and Colonel Thornton also
had some splendid flights. Sir Thomas Brown (cited by Harting,
<i>Bibl. Acc.</i> p. 27) says that a hawk, probably a peregrine,
made a flight at a woodcock nearly thirty miles in one hour.
The mention of so long a time suggests the inference that the
quarry &ldquo;put in&rdquo; several times, and was routed out. A famous
account is extant in print of a woodcock very well killed after
an unusually high flight by one of Major Fisher&rsquo;s peregrines.</p>

<p>Snipe are occasionally taken by peregrines that happen to
be waiting on when they rise. The first stoop is, of course,
dangerous for the snipe, but if he eludes that, a cast of the best
tiercels will hardly catch him. I have seen a female shaheen
hawking at snipe for her own pleasure, and saw her knock one
down very close to me in the long grass, but she could not find
it. Waiting for me to serve her, she remained for a while very
near over my head, and even took a dead snipe which I threw
up for her, but finding it cold dropped it after a yard or two&rsquo;s
flying. Mr. St. Quintin once flew a snipe hard with a good
game-tiercel of his, which bested it in the air, but it got off by
means of continually putting in to a deep ditch.</p>

<p>Many other birds are taken occasionally by peregrines when
they get up under the hawk, either while waiting on or coming
back from an unsuccessful flight. I saw a male kestrel taken
in this way&mdash;and very easily too&mdash;by an eyess game-tiercel of
Major Fisher&rsquo;s. Larks, too, are now and then taken when the
dog stands to them, and they are put up. Major Fisher had
a long flight once with a peregrine at a wild merlin, which was
very hard pressed, and at last put in to a thick hedge.</p>

<p>In some Oriental countries peregrines are commonly flown
at hares; but the sport is not one which would ever be popular
in highly civilised countries, for the falcon, or falcons, do not
bind to the animal like a goshawk. They deliver repeated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">« 149 »</a></span>
stoops at the head of the unfortunate creature, which is, of
course, no match for them in speed, and thereby in the long-run
deprive it of what little wits it had to start with. In
course of time this repeated buffeting reduces it to a state of
utter bewilderment and exhaustion, so that it can be held by
the falcons, or seized by the dogs which sometimes follow the
flight as their allies. In England, of course, a hare may be put
up by accident, and a falcon, waiting on, may stoop at it instinctively.
Parachute, the very excellent eyess falcon already
named, killed three hares in 1882. At one of these she was
flown intentionally, to show what she could do with him. She
kept striking him on the head till he was so exhausted that she
thought she could safely catch hold. But when she did so a
rough-and-tumble occurred, as it will in hawking with the goshawk;
and before it was ended, the very steady setter which
was out thought it time to run in and give the <i>coup de grâce</i>.
These were all Scotch hares; and the last-mentioned of them
weighed a full 6 lb.</p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">The Goshawk</span></p>


<p>No distinction was made when we were talking about hack
and the manning of hawks between the different species
to which they happen to belong. Nor is it necessary to insist
much upon the distinction even down to the time when they
have been reclaimed and are on the point of being entered.
But whereas all those which we have been considering are
&ldquo;hawks of the lure,&rdquo; we have seen that the short-winged hawks,
which remain now to be dealt with, are &ldquo;hawks of the fist.&rdquo;
Let us see what modifications must be made in the system of
training when it is the latter that we are preparing for the field.</p>

<p>In the first place, some authorities question altogether the
utility of hack for eyess goshawks or sparrow-hawks. Others
maintain that it is quite sufficient to let them loose in a shed or
empty room until their feathers are strong. This latter plan
seems a very poor sort of compromise between hack and no
hack. The eyesses so turned loose get no real liberty, and
nothing at all like the amount of exercise which they would if
they were in the open. Yet as compensation for what they
thus lose they get no advantage that one can easily understand.
Without pretending to decide the point in question, I may perhaps
venture to say that any hawk&rsquo;s muscles and eyes, as well
as her general health, are more likely to be improved by a free
life in the open air than in a sort of big cage. If they are not
hacked at all they may of course be very early made to the fist
and the hood, and will be manned and in flying order much
quicker than hack hawks. Whether this will be of advantage
or not, circumstances alone can decide; but a short-winged hawk
can generally be allowed a fairly long hack, and yet be ready
for her trainer&rsquo;s use as soon as the latter requires her services.
Of course it is not safe if there are other hawks out at hack to
let goshawks out anywhere in the vicinity; and I should be very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">« 151 »</a></span>
doubtful about the expediency of hacking sparrow-hawks in the
same place as merlins or kestrels. In fact it is not safe even to
peg out a goshawk in any place where hack merlins can come.
I remember an unfortunate jack&mdash;the smallest I ever saw&mdash;to
whom his owner had given the not very classical name of Jones.
This hawk was out at hack in a rather promiscuous way, killing
sparrows for himself occasionally, and at other times coming to
the lure. I think he knew we laughed at him, and thought that
life in general was a sort of joke. But one day the fancy seized
him to go and fraternise with a big young goshawk which was
out on her bow-perch, duly secured by the leash. The owner
was absent at the time; and when he returned there was nothing
left of poor Jones other than the feet and a sad litter of pretty
brown and white feathers round about the bow-perch.</p>

<p>When your short-winged hawk has been taken up from
hack, or at anyrate when she is to be taken in hand, her trainer
must set to work very seriously and very promptly at the
business of reclamation. This is not, it is true, different at
first in character from that required for the long-winged hawks.
But it is often different in degree; for personal attention and
almost perpetual care are a necessity. Unless you can contrive
to have her &ldquo;waked,&rdquo; you will have a tough job with her. Anyhow,
she must be carried almost all day. Whether eyess or wild-caught,
she should be treated very much like a haggard peregrine.
Almost superhuman efforts will be required in some cases
before she can be manned; yet manned she must be, and that
more thoroughly than a long-winged hawk, before you can hope
to do much with her. It required a Sir John Sebright to kill a
partridge with a sparrow-hawk ten days after she was caught;
and it would be still more difficult to kill a blackbird in that
time. That is, at least, to first kill it, and then take up the
hawk! For carrying is a vice to which the short-winged are
naturally disposed, though they are not so bad in this respect
as merlins or hobbies. In manning a short-winged hawk it will
generally be found better to work very hard for a few days than
to work only moderately hard for a much longer time. In fact,
a less amount of attention, if concentrated upon the pupil at
first, will do more than a much greater share applied to her in
smaller doses.</p>

<p>It is not usual to hood sparrow-hawks much after the time
when they are being reclaimed. But they should be kept, like
all other hawks, accustomed to being hooded, and not by any
means allowed to become hood-shy. And while the business of
reclamation lasts it is a good plan to tie the tail. This is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">« 152 »</a></span>
done by making a half-knot round the shaft of the outer feather,
nearly half-way down, passing the ends over and under the tail,
and making a double knot of them on the shaft of the outer
feather on the other side. When the hawk bathes the thread is
nearly sure to come off; and when she is dry you can put on
another. If it stays on, no harm is done. This simple device
ensures the tail feathers against any accident which might
otherwise occur while she is being handled by the trainer, and
perhaps by more or less incompetent assistants. Later on it
will be tried hard enough! Some falconers&mdash;and good ones,
too&mdash;despair of saving it for long; but you need not sacrifice it
sooner than you have any real occasion. The tail is just as
much&mdash;or as little&mdash;use to the hawk while she is being manned&mdash;or,
for that matter, when she is flying to the fist&mdash;whether it
is tied up or not; and in the former state it can come to no
harm. Let the hawk at least take her first quarry with undamaged
feathers. A moderate degree of coping will be found
permissible for short-winged hawks, although it is hardly orthodox
to say so. No doubt blunt claws would be detrimental to
these hawks in the field; but between bluntness and the needle-like
sharpness of the uncoped claw there is a world of difference.
The uncoped goshawk not only ruins the best glove in double-quick
time, but sometimes in starting from the fist does not
completely disengage all eight needles immediately from the
buckskin, and so is impeded, and flurried, and vexed in that
short temper of her own.</p>

<p>The strength of a goshawk&rsquo;s beak and feet is almost incredible;
and, this being so, it is well to be provided with good
store of useful tirings. Heads and necks of fowls will be
acceptable; and the more elderly and bony these creatures are
the better for the purpose. For during the long process of
carrying you will want to give your goshawk plenty of hard
morsels to pull at; and none but the toughest will withstand
for long the attacks of her sharp-pointed beak. The frequent
discussion of bony tirings will wear down that sharpness a
little, but I think not quite enough. Goshawks should not be
allowed to get at all thin, far less weak; on the other hand,
they should not be too freely fed. Half a crop a day of beef
or good fowl, or a little more of rabbit, is a very fair allowance,
if she has once a week, or rather oftener, a good gorge, with
plenty of castings, and the next day very short commons. As
soon and as much as possible she must be made to work for her
food. That is, she must earn it by showing every day some
improvement in her behaviour. If yesterday she bated off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">« 153 »</a></span>
twenty times in ten minutes, you may call it an improvement
to-day if she bates off only ten times in the same space of time.
So when she has walked even two inches for her food, it is an
improvement when she will walk four or five. Step by step
you must coax her to do more for you, rewarding her the
moment she has given way. And all the time you must be
making friends with her. Stroking with the stick or a feather
is always to be recommended. But you must be able also to
stroke her with your hand as you like without any remonstrance
or fear on her part. It is a troublesome job, do what you will,
the manning of a short-winged hawk. But the harder you
work, and the more patience you can exhibit, the better and
quicker you will succeed. It is best to be content at first if very
slow progress is made. In the later stages, if you make no
mistake, there will be days of much quicker improvement, such
as may even sometimes surprise your too desponding mind.
Thus though it may be days before you can get her to exchange
her walk to the fist for a jump, yet this feat once accomplished,
you may have quite a short time to wait before she flies to you
the length of the room. On the other hand, a hawk which has
come well to you indoors will perhaps not come a foot, or even
look at you, when first called off in the open air. Of course for
all the early out-door lessons the hawk will be secured by a
creance. It is well even to be a little extra-cautious in dispensing
with this safeguard, for if a goshawk when only half
trained does once make off, it is rather a chance if you ever
come up with her again.</p>

<p>In time your goshawk will be manned, and at least partly
reclaimed. She will look gladly on you when you come
near, and jump or fly to you on small encouragement for a small
reward. If you tease her with a morsel of meat, she will perhaps
make that quaint crowing sound which sounds like a mild protest
against your hard-heartedness. When you hold out your
fist temptingly with a nice piece of food in it, she will fly fifty
yards to you at once. If now you have carried her sufficiently
throughout the process of reclaiming, she will not need much
to bring her into &ldquo;yarak&rdquo;; that is, into a state of eagerness for
killing quarry. A small dose of purgative medicine may be
given, and after twelve hours&rsquo; fast, a small feed of very good
food, without any castings, and on the next day she may be
entered.</p>

<p>Female goshawks are now usually trained chiefly for hares
or rabbits. Males should always be tried first at partridges or
pheasants; and if they are not good enough for such quarry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">« 154 »</a></span>
may be degraded to water-hens and the like. The bagged
quarry for entering should, in the one case, be a rabbit, and in
the other, a partridge or house-pigeon. When a rabbit is used,
a short, tough cane may be attached crosswise to the end of a
very short creance, which will serve to prevent the quarry from
disappearing bodily down a burrow. The partridge or pigeon
should not, of course, be a first-rate flier; or, at least, he may
have a longer creance to carry. Let the hawk take her pleasure
on the first live quarry killed; and next day give a very
light feed, not later than noon. On the third day she may be
flown either at a better bagged quarry or at a wild one. She
should have a very good start for her first real flight, and in a
country free from burrows or impenetrable covert. Then, if she
only starts, she ought to kill in the case of a rabbit. Nothing
is more bloodthirsty than a young goshawk in yarak; nor,
in proportion to its size, has so much strength in its grasp.
When once the four long daggers with which each of her feet
is armed are imbedded in the head or neck of a rabbit or leveret,
it is generally all up with that unlucky beast. He may jump
and kick and roll over in his frantic efforts to escape. He may
by the latter tactics force the hawk to let go for a time, though
this is by no means always the result even of a complete somersault.
But if the grip is thrown off, the respite is short. Before
the quarry can make use of what wits are left to him, the pursuer
is on him again&mdash;this time probably with a still firmer hold
than before. Though a rabbit is fast for a quadruped, and the
goshawk slow for a hawk, yet the advantage in pace is always
with the latter; and though she may be thrown out again and
again by the doubles of the quarry, yet in an open space speed
must tell, if the pursuer is in condition.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as it is often difficult and sometimes impossible
to find rabbits in open places, it is advisable to let the first flight
for your beginner be as easy as you can. When she has taken
an undersized rabbit or leveret, she may be advanced to a full-grown
rabbit, and thence, after a few kills, to a full-grown hare,
if your ambition is to fly hares. Very possibly it may be necessary
to throw her off at the quarry and not expect her to start
of her own accord. She may also refuse more than once, and
yet be in the mind&mdash;that capricious and wayward mind of hers&mdash;to
fly. I have seen a young goshawk, only just trained,
taken out and thrown off at three or four hares in inviting
places, and have seen her refuse them all; and yet, ten minutes
later, I have seen her go at one like a whirlwind, and have it
down and helpless within sixty yards from the start. The flight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">« 155 »</a></span>
at hares rather overtaxes the powers of any except the strongest
female goshawks; and many people think that the flight at
rabbits is preferable, even in the quality of sport afforded. In
fact, the difference between the two is not so much one of speed
as of brute strength; and in quickness the rabbit will be found
generally superior. A goshawk which will take hares is the
more valuable; but it is doubtful if she shows any better sport.
Gaiety Girl, whose portrait is given, changed hands at £20, and
was well worth the money. This hawk, trained by Mr. A.
Newall on Salisbury Plain, killed no less than fifty-five hares
in one season, besides other quarry. Of course if goshawks
are to be flown at hares, they must be left strictly to this quarry
as far as possible, and not encouraged to ever look at a rabbit.</p>

<p>The goshawk has one great advantage over her nobler cousin,
the peregrine; she need not necessarily stop when her quarry
has gone into covert. Provided only that the covert is thin
enough for her to see the quarry, and to get along, she will stick
to him there as pertinaciously as in the open. She will naturally
not be so likely to succeed; trees and bushes will impede
her stoops, and give the quarry a far better chance of doubling
out of the way. But it is astonishing how clever even an eyess
goshawk can be in threading her way through covert, and
choosing the moment when a dash can be made. The hare is
not as well able to use her natural cunning in front of a hawk as
in front of a hound. The whole affair is so rapid, and the danger
behind is so pressing, that there is hardly time to devise, and still
less to put in practice, those tricks which are so successful in
hare-hunting. If one could only see it all, possibly the flight at
a hare in a thin covert would be better worth seeing than a
flight in the open. At any rate, the skill exhibited by the hawk
must be greater. For she not only has to keep the quarry in
view, and to make straight shots at him, but also in doing so
to avoid breaking her wing tips, or even her neck, against an
intervening tree.</p>

<p>The wild rush of the falconer&mdash;or ostringer&mdash;and his friends
after a flight at a hare in covert is also a thing to be seen. It is
unique of its kind. In magpie-hawking there is a lot of hurrying
up, much tumbling about, much laughter, and any amount of
shouting and noise; but there is not the same necessity for headlong
racing through the thicket. If you want to be &ldquo;in it&rdquo; with
a goshawk, you must go at a break-neck speed over or through
all obstacles; you must be able to see through screens of interlacing
boughs, and dash through almost impervious places.
You must cut off corners by instinct and follow by inspiration.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">« 156 »</a></span>
There is something in the impetuosity of a goshawk which is
contagious; and the ostringer, who has perhaps not marched at
the double for years farther than the length of a platform to
catch a train, may sometimes be seen tearing along with his very
best leg foremost, through bramble, thorn, and quagmire, in
hope of being in at the death. The whole sight is certainly
worth seeing. Artists are fond of depicting the goshawk as she
stands with outspread wings and half-open mouth with the hare
paralysed in her terrible foot. No better personification could,
indeed, be found of the pride of victory. The hare weighs
commonly three times as much as his captor; yet the victor
hawk must not only vanquish the hare, but also hold him fast.
It is almost as if a strong man were expected to hold a wild
zebra in his clutches. But the strength of a goshawk&rsquo;s grasp,
like that of the eagle&rsquo;s, must be tested by experience to be
properly understood.</p>

<p>The female goshawk, besides being flown at ground game,
may be trained to take many other quarry, both big and little.
At pheasants she may be expected to do good execution.
Partridges will sometimes be captured in fair flight when a
good start is made. Herons may be caught before they have
gone any distance on the wing. Wild geese, wild duck, and
wild fowl of various kinds in the same way. Land and water
rails are available; and water-hens are perhaps the favourite
objects of pursuit by a hawk that is not quite first-rate. Stoats,
weasels, and squirrels may be taken; and the harmful, unnecessary
rats will be picked up almost as fast as they can be driven
out. When ferrets are used there is a danger that one of them,
emerging from below, may be nailed and finished off by his
winged ally. In the old days goshawks were generally assisted
by spaniels; and it was pretty to see how eagerly and cleverly
the dogs backed up the chief actor in the play, while she in
turn trusted to them to drive the quarry in the right direction.
The conditions of modern game-preserving do not lend themselves
much to the use of spaniels; and perhaps they are not
so often of service to the gos, but they are frequently used. A
good retriever is often useful, especially if you are flying pheasants,
and the hawk should always be on the most amicable
terms with him.</p>

<p>Male goshawks are thought by some to have more speed
than their sisters. When they are good, they will take partridges,
with a good start, but not otherwise; and many of them will
tackle a pheasant. It is said that in some countries quails are
taken with the male. Very strong males will sometimes hold a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">« 157 »</a></span>
full-grown rabbit; but the effort is rather beyond their strength.
The flight of a gos is very peculiar. After a few fast flaps of the
wing she often spreads them a moment or two, and sails along,
giving to the falconer, who is accustomed to long-winged hawks,
the appearance of having left off. Almost immediately, however,
she begins moving her wings with greater vigour than
ever, and, gaining quickly this time on the quarry, comes at
him, sometimes with an upper-cut, if it is a bird, before you
think she can have had time to reach him.</p>

<p>Goshawks may be flown repeatedly the same day. In fact,
it is almost difficult to say when they have had enough flying.
But in this, as in all kinds of hawking, it is well to remember
that an extra good flight with success means an extra good
reward. If, therefore, after some indifferent or unsuccessful
flights, the hawk has flown hard and killed cleverly, I should
advise feeding her up, and not flying her again merely for the
sake of making a bigger bag. Under this system she may go
on improving indefinitely; and you will be rewarded for your
pains and labour at the beginning by possessing a hawk which
perhaps for years will give a good account of herself. I have
said that a goshawk which is intended for hares should be kept
to them alone. So, likewise, a male which is meant for partridges
should not be thrown off at pheasants or anything else.
But, as a general rule, there is no such necessity with the short-winged
hawks, as there is with the long-winged, of keeping
them from checking at odd quarry. The bag of a goshawk has
often been known to include four or five very different items, such
as a rabbit, a rat, a weasel, a pheasant, and a water-hen. These
sanguinary creatures are not particular as to what they kill
when they are in the humour for killing. They commit murder,
as foxes do, for the mere pleasure of it; and this you may
easily prove if you put out a number of fowls where a gos can
get at them. If you keep one in the same room where other
hawks are, and by any mischance her leash comes unfastened,
she is as likely as not to go round and massacre the whole lot.</p>

<p>Live fowls should never be given on any account to a goshawk.
If you can, you should prevent her from ever supposing
that they are good to eat, otherwise she may take a liking
to poultry, and seize every opportunity of helping herself to
the hens and chickens of your neighbours. The attraction of
poultry-yards is a great objection in places where there are
many of them, and some very good falconers have actually felt
themselves obliged on this account to discontinue keeping hawks.</p>

<p>Mr. Riley trains his own hawks, and, for convenience and for
saving time in an enclosed country, has sometimes used a lure.
He keeps them as hard at work as he can. He has much
difficulty in finding enough quarry for them, and is much
troubled by poultry. But for these causes the bags made would
have been even much larger than they were. He has a great
preference for haggards, whose style of flying he considers
very far superior to that of the eyesses. Tostin, especially,
used to shoot up some feet when he left the fist; and this
seemed to have a demoralising effect on the partridges. He
hit them so hard that the blow could be heard a long way off.
When he was unsuccessful, instead of coming straight back, he
would throw up two or three hundred feet, moving his head
from side to side as he flew. Sometimes he would come down
upon partridges on the ground, so as to put them up all round
him, and then, if there was no friendly hedge at hand, he was
pretty sure to have one. It was no doubt a great feat to get
him fully trained in so short a time after his capture as fifty-six
days. Pity his brilliant career was so soon ended by death!
Almost all the partridges taken, by one hawk or the other, were
captured in fair flight, without any routing about in hedges or
other covert.</p>

<p>To show what goshawks will do when well worked, I may
mention that Mr. St. Quintin&rsquo;s falconer (now the head falconer
of the Old Hawking Club) took out his female goshawk in
November 1885, and gave her seventeen chances at rabbits
lying out in the grass. She caught them all, but being a bit
blown, let the last one go. Sir Henry Boynton&rsquo;s goshawk, Red
Queen, on 2nd December 1895, killed as many as twenty-four
rabbits in one day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The illustration is a portrait of &ldquo;Gaiety Gal,&rdquo; the goshawk
which, while she was owned by Mr. Arthur Newall and flown
by him, killed in one season fifty-five hares, nineteen rabbits,
two pheasants, one partridge, one wood-pigeon, one Norfolk
plover, one landrail&mdash;total, eighty head. This fine hawk was
afterwards sold for £20; and the vendor always considered that
he had been a loser by the bargain.</p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">The Sparrow-Hawk</span></p>


<p>There is so little difference between the training of the
goshawk and that of the sparrow-hawk, that it is unnecessary
to give any special directions for the latter. But,
just as the merlin is a more delicate feeder and a more delicate
subject than the peregrine, so it must be remembered that the
diet and treatment of the smaller short-winged hawk must be
more <i>recherché</i> than that of the larger. This is more especially
true of the musket, or male sparrow-hawk, which is very
much smaller than his sister, and is in many respects a kind of
miniature hawk. Nothing in the shape of hard or tough meat
must ever be given to him. No long fasts, no hardships. He
must be always something of a spoilt child. And after he has
once been manned, the more he is petted and pampered the
better in most cases he will become. As far as my experience
goes, he has a better temper, and is more easily reclaimed than
his bigger sisters; but I have heard other falconers express a
contrary opinion. Both the ladies and gentlemen, however,
excluding exceptional cases, are, for a time at least, about as
troublesome creatures as ever wore a good pair of wings. For
the first few days after they are captured, or taken up from
hack, it seems quite impossible to make anything of them.
The beginner, unless he is of a most sanguine temperament,
may be excused for despairing of the prospect of ever reducing
them to obedience, and far more of ever using them profitably
in the field. And, to tell the truth, if he has had no previous
experience with a more docile kind of hawk, he seldom does
succeed.</p>

<p>Yet an old hand will tell you that, when taken properly in
hand, the sparrow-hawk becomes as trusty and hard-working a
servant as man can well wish to have. She will combine the
tameness of a parrot with the courage, and even ferocity, of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">« 161 »</a></span>
tiger, and will learn to treat her master to the amiable side of her
character, and the quarry to the other. She will go on flying
almost as long as you like to fly her, and start at one sort of
bird almost as readily as another. She will work in any kind
of country to which you introduce her; and if she does not
make a good bag it will not be for want of will on her part, or
for not doing her best. It seems almost that in proportion as
the difficulties of training are great, so is the result the more
gratifying when they have once been overcome. Mr. Riley,
who has flown both goshawks and sparrow-hawks with the
greatest ardour and success, is of opinion that from the point of
view of mere sport, the latter are even superior to the former.</p>

<p>In the good old days partridges seem to have been taken
pretty commonly with the female sparrow-hawk. But when I
say taken, I do not mean that many old birds were actually
caught in the air by the hawks. This would imply that the
old-fashioned sparrow-hawk was faster and stronger, as well as
better trained, than those of our own time. What often occurred
was no doubt that the partridge was pursued by the hawk, and
taken by the men or dogs. For the sight of this hawk, when
she really means business, is quite enough to take all the courage
out of even a bold partridge, and induce him to lie close in the
hedge or thicket into which he has been put, when he can be
grabbed by a spaniel or retriever, or even sometimes picked up
by hand. I make no question that the old-fashioned falconers,
by the aid of their drugs and nostrums, kept their hawks of all
kinds&mdash;and especially hobbies&mdash;in better condition than we do.
But even then it would probably have been considered quite a
feat to take old partridges on the wing with a sparrow-hawk.
And now, when the stubbles can only be called covert by
courtesy, and to get within fifteen yards of a bird is a rare
thing, it is certainly more difficult for us than it was for them to
get a fair start at one. But a time often comes in a day&rsquo;s
shooting when the birds, having been shot at a good deal, and
scattered like sheep without a shepherd, lie very close in a
patch of clover or thin roots. This would be the time for one
of the guns, who had brought out his falconer with a sparrow-hawk
in reserve, to call the latter forward. The rest of the
guns&mdash;or some of them at least&mdash;would probably be glad
enough to see so unusual a sight as a flight with a sparrow-hawk
at a partridge. Anyhow, the interruption to the business
of the day, while the little hawk was flown, would be very slight.
Of course a sparrow-hawk which is intended to fly partridges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">« 162 »</a></span>
should be kept, as Turbervile recommends, as much as possible
to &ldquo;big fowls.&rdquo; And there would always be more or less a risk,
unless the hawk was in first-rate condition,&mdash;in what is called
&ldquo;screaming yarak,&rdquo;&mdash;that she would refuse at the critical
moment the carefully marked bird, and put her owner to an
everlasting shame. A falconer who is afraid of this, however, is
not the sort of man who will ever do much good with any kind
of hawk nowadays.</p>

<p>The quarry <i>par excellence</i> of the sparrow-hawk is a blackbird.
Every female which is sound in wind and limb, and also
most males, ought to be able to take blackbirds, whereas it
must be an exceptionally strong and bold female which will be
good enough for the much more difficult flight at partridges.
The hawk referred to in the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i> seems to
have been an eyess musket. Unless, therefore, the falconer is
particularly ambitious and confident in himself and his hawks,
he had better lay himself out for blackbirds as the <i>pièce de
résistance</i>, with the chance of a few thrushes, starlings, water-hens,
and small birds to make up the bag. Peter Gibbs the
falconer told me that he had taken thirteen head of quarry,
varying in size from a partridge to a wren, in one day with a
female sparrow-hawk.</p>

<p>One advantage of the flight at blackbirds is that the quarry
is easy to find. Few enclosed countries in England are without
a good supply of them; and it is seldom that their haunts are
so secure that they cannot be dislodged so as to afford a flight.
Only a man must not go out blackbird-hawking all alone. He
should rather get as many people to join in the business as he
can. There is nothing unsociable or exclusive about a blackbird-hawking
expedition. The gardener, and the gardener&rsquo;s men, as
well as the keepers, the boys home for the holidays, and in short
everyone who is available, should all be encouraged to volunteer
as beaters, and help in the campaign against the plunderers of
the raspberry bushes. Formerly this sort of hedge-hunting was a
very popular amusement. Although in the fantastic apportionment
of hawks to different ranks and degrees, the sparrow-hawk
and musket were appropriated to ecclesiastics, it was a common
thing for yeomen and small landowners to keep and fly this
familiar and serviceable little creature. When Mr. Page says
that he has a &ldquo;fine hawk for the bush&rdquo; (<i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>,
Act iii. scene 3), he means that he has a sparrow-hawk which
will afford sport for a whole company of country-folk; and
when he and his friends go out the next morning after breakfast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">« 163 »</a></span>
&ldquo;birding,&rdquo; they may safely be supposed to get a morning&rsquo;s
sport very much of the sort that is now to be described.</p>

<p>Ruby looks very murderous as she sits with her thin yellow
fingers gripping the arch of yew which forms her bow-perch on
the lawn. The warm autumnal sun lights up her feathers in
their true colours of slatey brown on the back, and barred white
on the breast. Very keen and pitiless is her yellow eye as it
turns quickly towards each spot where the slightest unusual
movement attracts her notice. Presently, however, all her
attention is concentrated on one object, as her master steps
across the lawn. In a moment she is on to the outstretched
fist, where a well-known reward is almost always found. The
leash is untied; we are beckoned to come on, and we start at
once, accompanied by the terrier Sandy, with a knowing look
on his shrewd face. It is a warm still day, and we go straight
to the big meadow, where in the bottom hedge we put out a
thrush. Ruby is off the fist like lightning, and gains fast on
the quarry. Just as he turns to get into the hedge the hawk
makes a dash, which very nearly succeeds, but the thrush has
just managed to swerve out of the way, and, running along and
through the hedge, escapes on the other side, while Ruby
betakes herself to a tree hard by. Before she is called down a
blackbird is sighted near the same tree, and we form a line so
as to drive him towards the hawk. This, however, does not
accord with the views of our black friend in the bush, who
resists our well-meant endeavours, and tries to work his way
past us away from the tree. Fortunately there are enough of
us to frustrate his efforts, and prevent him from shirking along
the hedge. He is obliged to take a line across the field, and as
soon as he is well away from the fence Ruby is up to him.
In shifting from the stoop he dashes himself against the
ground, and even by this violent effort does not wholly escape,
as the hawk hits him hard as she passes overhead. He picks
himself up at once and makes for the hedge, but is just too late,
as Ruby grabs him just as he is entering.</p>

<p>Passing on to another long hedge we soon get a flight
at another blackbird, which puts in before the hawk gets up.
Ruby will not wait, but goes on to an oak at the end of the
hedge. We beat on, with a view to drive him towards the
hawk, and find that there is more than one blackbird in front
of us. One of these is driven out, and Ruby makes a fine stoop
at him out of the tree, but fails to hit him, and he puts in. After
several tries he is persuaded to fly out into the open, and make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">« 164 »</a></span>
for some bushes that are not far off, but as he goes the hawk
knocks him over with a severe cut, and though he gets up again
and staggers on, she has him well before he can reach the bush.
With the next blackbird we have no end of excitement under
and round a tree in the fence, the fugitive several times baffling
us as we are driving him along towards a bare place in the
hedge, and compelling us to hark back and begin driving him
up again. Once he comes out a yard, and whips back again
instantly. The hawk goes again up into an oak-tree near the
gate. Now we drive on furiously, hoping that at the gate,
anyhow, he will take wing. Some time before we get there he
loses patience and ventures a flight across the field. Ruby gets
a poor start, but the blackbird makes a bad use of his chance,
allowing the hawk to recover lost ground rapidly, and makes
such a weak attempt to get inside a brake that he is taken on
the top&mdash;perhaps dazed with all the noise and hustling in the
fence.</p>

<p>The next is a very plucky young cock, found in a short
piece of hedge by a wire fence. In and out of the wire fence
he shifts very cleverly, and only just saves himself in a holly
bush. Here he establishes himself in a nearly impregnable
fortress, made up of an earth-bank, with some tangled roots,
and an infinity of quickset, wild rose, and bramble. The yapping
of Sandy, the shouts of the beaters, and the howls of an under-gardener,
who in the ardour of pursuit has torn his cheek open
with a briar&mdash;all are unavailing to storm the citadel until someone
with a well-directed thrust nearly pins him by the tail.
Then at last he is off in real earnest towards a thick brake.
Before he can get there Ruby compels him with a knock on
the back to drop down on the ground, and though he gets up
and shuffles into the brake, he is evidently the worse for wear.
It takes ten minutes&rsquo; hard work to dislodge him again, and
even when dislodged he dodges back after going a few yards.
At last, as it is getting dark, he happens to go out just under
the spot where the hawk is sitting, and she collars him above
the ditch, dropping into it with him. A flight of half an hour,
&ldquo;including stoppages,&rdquo; and hard work all the time&mdash;for the
men!</p>

<p>Another day we are out with Lady Macbeth, a young eyess
with broad shoulders, large feet, and a very small head. The
luck is against us at first. We are foiled by a blackbird and
outflown by a thrush, and have failed to find any water-hens.
At length a blackbird is marked down in a field of swedes in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">« 165 »</a></span>
the open, and we adjourn there, full of hopes. The tactics
adopted by this blackrobed gentleman are simple, but ingenious
and effective. They consist of flopping down, as the hawk gets
quite near, into a thick bunch of turnip leaves, and, when once
on the ground, doubling round the stalks so as to elude the
hawk, which, of course, dives into the damp covert at the same
place where the quarry disappeared. Then when the hawk&rsquo;s
head is safe behind the leafy screen of verdure, the chance
comes of jumping up and slipping off unseen. Twice does Lady
Macbeth detect him in the act of thus slinking off; but she is
thrown out again by the same stratagem, and on the third
occasion the fugitive gets off unseen by his persecutor, though
in full sight of us, and also of Sandy, who yelps demoniacally,
either from pure vexation, or perhaps in the hope of attracting
the attention of his friend and ally. Well, of course, we lose
that fellow, who goes off joyously over the hedge and the next
field, glorying, like Ulysses, in the success of his wiles. More
valuable to magpie and blackbird than the rather limited allowance
of wing-power with which Nature has provided them, is
the considerable supply of brains by which the balance is
made up.</p>

<p>At last, however, we get a bit of luck, which indeed makes
it rather a red-letter day for Lady Macbeth, for as we beat
along one of the least likely-looking hedge-rows, more for the
sake of doing the proper thing than with a hope of finding
anything, there is a huge flurry and bustle almost under the
feet of our falconer, and up gets a single partridge, beating the
air noisily with broad, round wings as he gets clear of the
overgrown ditch. When he is once fairly on the wing he will
soon put on a pace nearly, if not quite, equal to any that our
hawk can attain to. That is, he &ldquo;would&rdquo; rather than he &ldquo;will,&rdquo;
for we have not been idle all this time. On the contrary, Lady
Macbeth, somewhat startled at first, spreads her wings, and at
once shoots upwards, as if with a view to see what is the matter.
Then, pulling herself together as she takes in the situation, she
makes a sort of half-turn in the air, comes down in a slanting
course, half stooping and half flying, and before the partridge
has gone forty yards, strikes him full on the back with both
feet. One, at least, of the eight sharp claws hold, and down
they come with a whack on the brown earth of the ploughed
field, where they seem almost to roll over one another in the
excitement of the fray which has still to be fought out. For a
real set-to it is, of the rough-and-tumble order. The hawk&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">« 166 »</a></span>
claws, long and sharp as they are, do not penetrate to any vital
part of the partridge as they do when a sparrow is the victim.
Nor do her long spindle-like legs look as if they could do much
service in a wrestling bout, when opposed to the short, stout,
and very muscular understandings of the other. But Lady
Macbeth makes play with her wings and tail as well as her feet
and legs, otherwise she could be upset and shaken off in no
time. Half a dozen long feathers pressed down into the ground
on each side prevent her from being thrown to right or left; a
dozen almost equally long and elastic feathers behind steady
her still further, and act as a sort of drag if the struggling
partridge tries to rush forward and so free itself. So, though
the encounter is fierce, as the two feathered bodies sway about
spasmodically over the rough surface of the furrow, the assailant
keeps the upper hand; and soon the allied forces come up in
support. The trainer, joyous at the tardy success which has
crowned his afternoon, gets hold of one of the partridge&rsquo;s wings
and holds it down, so that the kicks and scratchings to which
he now resorts are wasted on the insensible clods beneath.
The hawk now shifts one foot from the shoulder to the head;
two claws imbed themselves in the face and neck. A third,
sad to say, pierces the falconer&rsquo;s unguarded thumb; but though
he moans with the pain, he does not withdraw his hand till he has
cleared it from the hooked claw. Then, with sharp knife, he
severs the partridge&rsquo;s jugular vein, and, opening the skull, allows
the hawk to pick out the brain. Lady Macbeth will now be
fed up; she has had some work and some encouragement, and
we shall next time try to find her another short start at a
partridge.</p>

<p>One of the merits of &ldquo;birding&rdquo; with a sparrow-hawk is
that everyone out is always busily engaged. Everyone thinks
that he has marked the exact spot where the fugitive put in,
and can lay his hand at once on the place where his cunning
head is hiding under the ferns or leaves. And yet when the
hedge is reached these boastings are all falsified, and the hiding-places
seem all to be bare. &ldquo;He never stopped in the hedge at
all,&rdquo; says one. &ldquo;Yes he did. He doubled down to the right.&rdquo;
"He climbed up into the middle." &ldquo;Hark, there! I heard him
flutter.&rdquo; "You make such a confounded row with your argumentation;
no one can hear anything." &ldquo;There he goes!&rdquo;
"No; that&rsquo;s Sandy." &ldquo;I see him now.&rdquo; "To the left!"
&ldquo;Keep him back.&rdquo; "Cut him off." And so the chase goes on.
Lady Macbeth, or Ruby, sits quietest of all on the commanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">« 167 »</a></span>
bough, though her yellow eyes glitter with excitement, and her
legs and wings are ready for a start the moment that a black
feather shows itself. It is equally hard to grab an old cock
blackbird in the hedge, or to drive him out of it far enough to
give the hawk a chance of a fair shot. As for the thrushes,
they seem to puzzle a sparrow-hawk more even than the wiliest
of their black cousins. They have more wing-power, too, and
are apt to distance her in fair flight. A starling is, I believe,
not an easy bird to take if he has anything of a start. Wood-pigeons,
when taken by wild sparrow-hawks, must probably be
caught unawares.</p>

<p>A small wiry-haired dog which is not afraid of thorns will
often be useful. Sandy is not without his honours in the hawking-field.
Many a blackbird has he snapped up in his mouth
within a yard of his formidable ally, in whose presence the
quarry thinks that almost anything is preferable to a flight
across the open. Then the victim is, of course, taken from him&mdash;often
unhurt&mdash;for Sandy is too well bred and too well trained
to injure it if he can help doing so; and with the orthodox cry
of &ldquo;Ware, hawk! ware!&rdquo; is thrown out to the hawk. Water-hens
are a rather favourite quarry for the female sparrow-hawk, as
well as for the goshawk, when she is not a very distinguished
performer. A water-spaniel which knows how to work with a
hawk is in each case very useful. Landrails would afford a
capital flight if they were plentiful enough, and could be
induced to give themselves a fair start, instead of waiting to be
kicked up when the hawk is close upon them.</p>

<p>But perhaps the best flight of all, next to partridges, is at
the quail, and it is one in which the musket can be employed as
well as his sister. The Italian authorities, upon whom Turbervile
draws for the chief part of his treatise on falconry, speak
of the quail as the special quarry of the sparrow-hawk, and give
minute directions for this flight, which could, of course, be had
in perfection in the Egyptian paddy-fields, and in other parts
of the East. It is said that some of the tribes tributary to the
Grand Turk, who had to pay their tribute in quails, used to provide
themselves by means of sparrow-hawks alone with the necessary
number of birds. The African falconers, when in pursuit
of quails, take the sparrow-hawk round the body in their right
hand, and as the quarry rises throw her at them like a round-hand
bowler, thereby giving her an initial impetus, of which she
seems fully to understand the advantage. In some places they
surround the neck of the hawk with a <i>halschband</i>, or linen collar,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">« 168 »</a></span>
which serves to steady the flight. The Besra sparrow-hawk, as
has already been said, is used as well as the common species.</p>

<p>A quotation from the last-named author will here, perhaps,
be found to the point. &ldquo;Set your sparrow-hawke,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;every morning abroade in the sunne two houres, or neare
thereabouts, and set her to the water twice in a weeke at the
least, and especially nyasses, for they covet the water more
than the rest. Soar sparrow-hawks should not be flown withal
too soone in a morning, for they soare willingly. Take your
sparrow-hawke from the pearche alwayes with somewhat in
your hand, to make her love you, and be fond of you, for that is
a thing of no small importance and consideration. And also to
make your sparrow-hawke foot great fowles, to the end that she
may not learn nor be accustomed to carrion. And as touching
mewing of a sparrow-hawke, some use to put her in the mew
as soon as they leave fleeing with her, cutting off both her
bewits, lines, and the knots of her jesses, and leave her in the
mew until she be cleane mewed. But if you will have her to
flee at partridge, quail, or the feazent poult, then you must
draw her in the beginning of April, and have her on the fist
till she be cleane and thoroughly enseamed. And they which
delight in haggarts must take great heede that they offend
them not, but rather coy them as much as they can, with all
devices of favour and cherishing. For they will remember
favor or injurie much better than any kind of hawke. And he
which hath a haggart sparrow-hawke must above all thinges
take paines in weyning her from that vile fault of carrying:
and that shall he do by serving her often with greate pullets
and other great traines, the which she cannot carry, and thereby
she will learne to abide upon the quarry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Riley has given me some extracts from his hawking
diary, in which the following scores are recorded:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="hanging">Blanche (eyess female), 1885-86&mdash;44 blackbirds, 13 thrushes,
1 partridge, 2 small birds.</p>

<p class="hanging">Lady Mabel (eyess female), 1887-88&mdash;56 blackbirds, 5
thrushes, 4 water-hens, 3 partridges, 1 pheasant, 2 small
birds.</p>

<p class="hanging">Faerie (eyess female), 1889-90&mdash;64 blackbirds, 3 thrushes,
4 water-hens, 1 partridge, 4 small birds.</p>

<p class="hanging">Ruby (eyess female), 1894-95&mdash;106 blackbirds, 1 partridge,
1 starling, 1 small bird.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">« 169 »</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging">Princess (wild-caught female), 1895-96 (Nov. 11 to March 24)&mdash;39
blackbirds, 1 thrush.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of these the wild-caught Princess, though injured in the leg
by a trap, was very superior in her style. Ruby at the end of
the season flew very like a wild hawk. This Ruby was wonderfully
fast and clever, and an excellent footer. The number of
blackbirds she killed stone dead by stoops out of trees was
astonishing. In size she did not exceed the average. Speaking
from an experience of a great many years, and with
an authority which everyone must acknowledge, Mr. Riley
declares that &ldquo;no sport with a female goshawk can touch that
to be got with a good female sparrow-hawk.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Home Life</span></p>


<p>Probably the commonest fault in young falconers of
the modern school is that of keeping too many hawks.
Almost every writer on the subject has warned them over and
over again against this rage for being &ldquo;over-hawked&rdquo;; and yet
it is still the cause of endless failures, disappointments, and
disasters. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know, if I lose one I like to have
another to fall back upon.&rdquo; Such is the excuse, and a very
bad one it is. If a beginner can manage to keep one hawk of
any kind in flying order he may consider himself exceptionally
clever; and the sole charge of a cast of hawks is quite as much
as any amateur ought to undertake, unless he is blessed with a
great deal more leisure time than is usually the case. An
experienced professional falconer, with a boy to help him, and
with nothing else to occupy his time, may manage an establishment
of three short-winged hawks, or about five long-winged,
or one of the former and three of the latter, short-winged
hawks, when in flying condition, requiring about twice as much
attention as their nobler cousins. But if it is desired to keep
up a larger establishment, there should be, counting in the head
falconer, one man, or at least one boy, to every two hawks.</p>

<p>A falconer who attends properly to his charges will find
that they monopolise a very large portion of every day&mdash;at anyrate
from the time when the eyesses arrive, in early summer, to
the end of the rook-hawking season in spring. His duties may
be divided into those which we may call normal or permanent,
and which relate to the hawks which are already in flying
order, and only require to be flown and kept in working
condition, and exceptional or special duties, such as the hacking
of eyesses, and the manning and reclaiming of hawks which
are newly caught, newly taken up, or newly removed from
the moulting-place. Thus, as in other professions, there are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">« 171 »</a></span>
times of extra pressure, when every hour in a long day has its
full complement of busy work, and times of comparative rest,
when the labour is a good deal lighter. But at all times the
falconer, if he is to excel, must be possessed of certain qualifications,
either innate in him or carefully acquired, which will
enable him to become a favourite amongst his winged pupils
and servants.</p>

<p>Among such qualities the foremost is prudence. A moment
of carelessness, or even inattention, may almost every day
entail the loss of a valuable hawk. A knot insecurely fastened,
a door inadvertently left open, a leash or jess that has become
unsound,&mdash;all these are examples of small imprudences, some
one of which many a falconer will bitterly remember to have
been the cause of a catastrophe. Cleanliness and tidiness are
virtues none the less desirable in a professional falconer because
they were, and still are, a little rare. It is not so easy a matter
as it may at first be supposed to keep a hawk-house clean and
neat; and the very first aspect of many such places speaks
volumes for the character of the owner or his servants. The
person who has to manage hawks should be gentle in all his
dealings with them. He should have the touch of an organist
rather than of a pianist; the hands of a sculptor rather
than of a wrestler or quoit-player. Any hurried or sudden
movement is offensive and alarming to hawks; and rough
treatment of any kind disgusts and makes enemies of them.
Patience and a good temper are quite as necessary to a falconer
as to an angler&mdash;probably more so, as the difficulties and
injustices with which the falconer is confronted under modern
conditions exceed those which are met with in any other kind
of sport. He must be a good judge of the characters of
animals, and of their moods and fancies, for there is as much
difference in the dispositions of hawks as of human beings, and
no two of them, except by a rare accident, can be treated
successfully in exactly the same way. His sight and hearing
must be good, for much depends upon his ability to keep a
long flight in view, and to distinguish the sound of a hawk&rsquo;s
bell in a high wind, amidst the rustle of leaves and grass, the
murmur of a stream, or the pattering of rain.</p>

<p>In the golden age of falconry great weight was attached to
the possession of good lungs. The &ldquo;falconer&rsquo;s voice,&rdquo; for which
Juliet fondly wished, was used not only to lure the tassel-gentle
back again, but to encourage him in his efforts, and to cheer
his successful or brilliant strokes. A modern trainer is not so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">« 172 »</a></span>
demonstrative. We have&mdash;wrongly, I think&mdash;almost abandoned
the use of calls and cheers to animate our winged friends in the
air. But even now a loud voice is a merit in a falconer, if only
as enabling him from afar to warn the field and any chance
intruders not to meddle with a flight or run in to a hawk that
has killed. Those few who still make a practice of &ldquo;giving
their voice&rdquo; to their hawks are, I think, well repaid for their
trouble. For no one can doubt how attentive hawks are to
sounds, especially of the human voice, or how thoroughly they
become convinced, when well handled, that they and their
followers on foot or horseback, and the dogs, when there are
any, are all friends and comrades engaged, each in his different
way, in the same campaign against the same quarry.</p>

<p>As the huntsman in his kennels, and the trainer in his
stables, so the good falconer should take a pride in his mews,
or in the place, whatever he calls it, where his hawks are
lodged. We have abandoned for the most part the old name
of mews&mdash;long ago degraded to a new signification&mdash;and with
it the fashion of building proper quarters for the accommodation
of our feathered friends. The modern hawk-house is often
a poor substitute for the substantial buildings which our
ancestors called mews. Nowadays almost any outhouse seems
to be thought good enough for the purpose; and the trained
hawks of several amateurs who are justly reputed good falconers
are housed in what are little more than shanties, barely able to
keep out the rain and wind, and not at all proof against that
insidious enemy, the damp. There can be no doubt that the
excessive prevalence in our times of the horrible disorder called
&ldquo;croaks&rdquo; is largely due to the want of care with which our
hawks are housed in winter.</p>

<p>A hawk-house should have solid walls, and a floor well
raised above the ground, so as to be impervious to damp. It
should have a loft or room above it, which will help to save it
from extreme variations of temperature by day and by night.
In such a place all hawks, except merlins and those which have
come from any hot climate, may be kept through all ordinary
weathers, care being taken, of course, that the ventilation is
sufficient, but in winter not excessive. In times of severe frost
or excessive damp a very moderate amount of artificial heat
should be introduced. A very good arrangement, when it can
be adopted, is for the back wall of the hawk-house to be also
the back wall on the other side of a warm conservatory or
well-heated room. In such cases it is unnecessary, unless in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">« 173 »</a></span>
exceptional winters, to have any heating apparatus in the hawk-house
itself. Merlins and the tropical hawks, such as shaheens,
barbarys, and also the desert falcons, should, in cold or damp
weather at least, be placed in a room which is over a very
well-warmed apartment, and has the flue of one chimney at
least running along one of its sides. A room immediately
above a kitchen is pretty safe in all weathers for all hawks if
the fire is kept up all night, but not otherwise. Where the
room is unavoidably isolated, there must be a stove or some
heating apparatus; but the heat thrown out must be very
moderate indeed, or the hawks when taken out for weathering,
or even when left stoveless by day, are nearly sure to catch
cold. Changes of temperature in our islands are sudden and
severe enough when due to natural causes only, but if they are
produced by artificial means no hawk can be expected to
endure them with impunity, and least of all gers, merlins, and
the denizens of the sunny south. The hardiest hawks are
peregrines and hobbies, but these, too, must be given a fair
chance, even if it entail upon their owner some inconvenience
and expense. Whenever the weather is very wet or damp,
with penetrating fogs, opportunity should be taken, when the
hawks are all out on their blocks or being carried, to warm the
hawk-house thoroughly by artificial means, and purge it of all
suspicion of damp.</p>

<p>Adjoining the hawks&rsquo; apartment should be another small
room, where lures and spare &ldquo;furniture&rdquo; can be kept. Meat
and food of all kinds should be rigorously excluded from the
first-mentioned room, but may be kept, if it is quite fresh, on
an emergency in the other, where blocks and bow-perches when
taken in out of the rain can be deposited. On the walls in either
room may be hung on small pegs or nails the hoods for each
kind of hawk; but it is well to mark clearly above each peg a
description of the sort of hood which is intended to be there
hung, so that in a case of hurry one may not be mistaken for
another, and a tiercel&rsquo;s hood crammed on to a falcon, or a
female hobby&rsquo;s be found wobbling about on the head of a jack-merlin.
Every falconer should have in his cupboard a tin box
containing a supply of imping needles suitable for the hawks
which he keeps, and some spare feathers ready for imping.
The same box will hold other small paraphernalia and odds-and-ends,
such as waxed thread, pincers for &ldquo;coping&rdquo; or
blunting the beak and talons, tweezers for putting on jesses,
punches for making holes in leashes, scissors, files, and a scrap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">« 174 »</a></span>
of thin leather for making jesses and bewits. Or there may
be a compartment where ready-made jesses, bells, swivels, and
spare leashes are stored. The lures, well cleansed from all food
that has been attached to them, and the hawking gloves, can
have their proper place in the side-room.</p>

<p>If the building inhabited by the hawks is large, the upper
part may be used as a loft wherein to moult them. If there
are hawks of different kinds to be moulted, it must be divided
into separate compartments, so that no two of very different size
may be together. And each individual goshawk must have a
room for itself. It would not be safe to turn falcons and tiercels
loose together, nor a female with a male sparrow-hawk.
Merlins and jacks may be left together, and in the same place
with male hobbies; and probably peregrine tiercels with female
shaheens, lanners with lannerets, and perhaps barbarys. But it
is not very wise to risk the chumming together of any dissimilar
hawks at a time when they are all kept in specially
high condition, with no work to do, and ready for the mischief
which Dr. Watts assures us is a natural concomitant of idleness.
Of course if there is a living-room above the hawks, or above
the furniture-room, it may serve most conveniently for a
falconer&rsquo;s or under-falconer&rsquo;s bedroom, enabling him to be at
hand by night as well as day in case there should be anything
wrong, such as a hawk hanging by her jesses from the perch, or
a scuffle amongst hawks moulting in the same compartment.</p>

<p>At six o&rsquo;clock in summer, and as soon as it is light in winter,
the falconer should be in the hawks&rsquo; room. If newly-caught
hawks are there, they will be in a compartment from which all
daylight has been excluded. Taking them one by one on the
fist, he will put on their hoods, and then, lighting a candle, or
admitting enough light, he will search for their castings under
the screen-perch. If any one of them which has had castings
the day before should not have yet cast, he must either put her
back on the perch in the dark, or else, if she is far enough
advanced in training for this, hand her over to an under-falconer
to be carried till she has performed that operation. Under
the place occupied by each hawk the pellet should be looked
for and examined before it is thrown away with the sweepings
of soiled sawdust collected under the perches. As the falconer
ascertains that each hawk has cast up a healthy pellet, well-shaped
and free from oily mucus, he will be doing no harm if
he presents her with a mouthful or two of food, by way of a
morning salutation, and just to show that there is no ill-will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">« 175 »</a></span></p>

<p>Then if it is a fine morning, there will probably be a hawk or
two which may with advantage be pegged out, either in the
sunshine, if she is fond of it, or under the cool shade of a tree.
At anyrate, there will be a hawk which will be none the worse
for half an hour&rsquo;s carrying; and if there are merlins, it will be
none too early to fly them to the lure. Every falconer, each
time he rises, ought to take note of the weather, marking especially
the direction and strength of the wind, and should do his
best to forecast how the day will turn out. If he sees reason to
expect a stormy afternoon, he will prepare to fly the hawks as
early as he can; whereas, if it is already blowing or raining
hard, he may think it best to provide for the possibility of a late
start, taking the chance of an improvement in the weather at
midday, or later. He should decide betimes which hawks are
certain not to be taken out to the field, and make sure that
their allowance of food is ready to be given them early in the
day. Such hawks may generally be put out early in the
morning, and provided with tirings, at which they may pull
away contentedly on their blocks till it is time either to fly them
to the lure, or to give them their ration on the fist. In the
game-hawking season there will be a consultation with the
keeper as to the country to be visited and the dogs to be taken
out; and the falconer, having an eye to the direction of the wind,
will plan out provisionally the sort of tactics which it will be best
to adopt in beating the ground. Beaters and markers should
also be secured, and directed as to the order of the day&rsquo;s proceedings,
whether the business in hand is grouse-hawking, lark-hawking,
or any other form of sport for which these attendants
are required.</p>

<p>After breakfast, on sunshiny days, there will generally be
candidates for the bath. Fresh water must be brought; and in
very cold weather a cup or two of hot water may be added, to
take off the chill. Each hawk, after bathing, should have an
hour at least to dry and air herself in the sun and wind. In
emergencies, on cloudy days, the old falconers used to dry their
hawks after bathing by holding them with their backs to a
fire. Hawks do not usually care to take a bath much before
eleven o&rsquo;clock; and they should not be indulged with one after
half-past twelve. Those which have bathed will, of course, not
be ready to fly till well on in the afternoon, especially as they
will have had a very light feed in the early morning, as it is not
good to let a hawk bathe on a quite empty stomach. The
falconer will generally like to be present while the hawks bathe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">« 176 »</a></span>
so that he will not be ready to start for the field, even with
those that have not bathed, much before noon. This hour,
moreover, is full early for peregrines and most of the larger
hawks, which are apt to be slack in the pursuit of their quarry
when they have, or at least think they have, the best part of
the day before them in which to provide themselves with their
one daily solid meal.</p>

<p>Hawks which are not yet thoroughly accustomed to the
hood should be hooded up with care, so as to avoid any trial of
their temper just as they are about to be called upon to do their
best. Hawks, of course, ought always to be good at the hood;
but some manifest an obstinate repugnance to it, as for instance
Vesta, the very excellent game-falcon trained for the Old
Hawking Club. The duties of the falconer in the field are referred
to at length in the next chapter. As soon as he has
returned&mdash;which will usually not be much, if at all, before dark&mdash;he
must be satisfied that each hawk has had the full allowance
of food which he had decided to be good for her, that her
beak and talons are fairly clean, her feathers in good order, and
her swivel and leash properly attached. Then each will be
put in her accustomed place on the screen-perch, the leash
being securely tied round the perch itself, as described in
<a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter <span class="smcap">III</span>.</a>, and the hood, if she is hooded, removed and hung
up.</p>

<p>As for the hawks, if any, which, not being destined for the
field, have been left at home, either at blocks on the lawn, or
indoors, some person will have been left to shift their blocks as
they become exposed to the sun, to carry them for a specified
time, and perhaps to fly some of them to the lure. Every
trained hawk, unless she is put down to moult, or is being
flown at quarry, should be exercised daily to the lure or the fist&mdash;merlins
twice, and all others once. The methods of giving
exercise have been already described; but it must be remembered
that when once a hawk has been entered the more
real flying in the field she gets the better. Otherwise you are
between the horns of a dilemma. If you give no exercise the
hawk grows heavy, stale, and lazy. If you fly her too much to
the lure she may grow too fond of it, and less keen at wild
quarry. Good practical falconers are thus rather averse to a
too free use of the lure with peregrines and lanners. On the
other hand, I have found that merlins cannot well have too
much stooping at the lure. Rook-hawks, and others which are
never expected to wait on at a height, may often be made to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">« 177 »</a></span>
a large amount of pretty fast flying when stooping at the dead
lure. This sort of practice is of course not to be encouraged in
the case of game-hawks or duck-hawks, as tending to lower their
pitch, which it is the chief desire of the falconer to keep as high
as possible. But long-winged hawks, even in the mere act of
waiting on, especially in a strong wind, get a good breather
and a good stretching of their wings, if they are always allowed
to be uncertain in their own minds whether in the end it will be
a partridge or a pigeon that they will have to come down for,
or merely the dead lure.</p>

<p>As for the short-winged hawks, and for such others as will
not keep on the wing willingly without going to perch, they
must be exercised chiefly by the device known as calling off.
The most effective plan is that mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter <span class="smcap">VI</span>.</a>, where
two men go out, and, standing at a distance from one another,
alternately bring the hawk across the intervening space by
showing the lure or the outstretched fist. If two men are not
available the hawk may be deposited on a railing, gate, or post,
and the falconer may walk away, hiding his hands, and when
he is as far off as he likes, or as the hawk will allow him to go,
may call her and reward her with a few morsels, and then put
her down again for the operation to be repeated. A trained
hawk will often follow the falconer about for a long time, as he
walks along, waiting a while in expectation of being called, and,
if disappointed, flitting to a nearer resting-place, or coming
right up to him on the chance that his hand will be held out;
and if it is not, betaking herself to a neighbouring tree or other
convenient place. Such excursions as these, in a park or on
the downs, with a favourite hawk always in sight, either in
the air or on a conspicuous perch of her own choosing, afford
an opportunity of indulging her with the best possible sort of
weathering. It is the nearest approach which can safely be
made to giving trained hawks their liberty.</p>

<p>It is a common thing with writers on hawking to recommend
their readers, when a trained hawk is out of sorts, to put
her on a pair of hack-bells, and turn her out to hack for a while. I
desire to speak with all respect of a practice which has doubtless
been often attempted with success; but I am compelled to
say that my own experience is altogether unfavourable to any
such experiment. Attempts that I have known made to keep
trained hawks at hack have not only failed, but have over and
over again entailed the loss of the bird operated upon, sometimes
for a time, and sometimes permanently. A strong and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">« 178 »</a></span>
clever hawk, even if she is a bit unwell, and even if she is
weighted heavily, will manage to kill something, if she has a real
mind to it; and even if she does not, her wanderings may lead
her first out of sight, and then into some neighbouring field or
place, where a stray gunner may make an end of her. I am
not able to advise beginners to turn their hawks loose for any
longer time than they themselves or some agent can be near at
hand, unless it be in the case of a kestrel or hobby, or other
hawk which has never killed wild birds regularly in fair flight.</p>

<p>No ordinary bad weather should deter a falconer from
taking his long-winged hawks out to exercise. Rain, unless it
is very heavy, will do a hawk no harm during the short time she
is flying to the lure or being called off. Even if the rain is
heavy, an umbrella can be held over the hawk as she is carried
to the exercise-ground and back. Wind must be very high
indeed before the trainer should hesitate to fly his hawks at
exercise. When they are to be merely called off, they will,
when sharp-set, if in good condition, face half a gale of wind.
But the two men should, in this case, post themselves rather
across wind, and not one exactly down-wind of the other; otherwise
the hawk of the up-wind man will have her head always
turned directly away from the other, and moreover, if she comes
fast towards the latter, may be carried so far past him that she will
not take the trouble to fetch up again, and struggle up-wind to
a lure of which she has once been disappointed. A game-hawk,
especially if it is a passager, should not be kept waiting on
very long on a boisterous day. Should she, while in the air,
catch sight of a wood-pigeon or house-pigeon down-wind, and
give chase, she may be out of sight in a moment, and, if the
quarry takes the air, may go miles before you can run or ride
five hundred yards. The best hawks rather enjoy flying in a
very high wind, and seem to take an obvious pride in exerting
their mastery over it. Their stoops at the lure in such weather
are often exceptionally fine; and the tremendous pace at which
the wind enables them to come down, evidently affords them
much inward satisfaction.</p>

<p>In hot and sunny weather some caution is advisable in
flying hawks to the lure, as well as in the field. For when in
high condition, even if they are hungry, they are sometimes
disposed to go soaring, and, as it were, forgetting all about mundane
affairs, disappear in airy circles down-wind. Eyesses will,
it is true, generally come back when they are tired of soaring.
They are reminded, sooner or later, by an internal feeling that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">« 179 »</a></span>
there is such a thing as a garnished lure in the foreground.
But suppose a passage peregrine, after stretching her wings for
five minutes at a height of a thousand feet, to catch sight of a
wood-pigeon crossing the open down. It would be almost too
much to expect that she should resist the temptation. In the
cool of the day, morning and evening, hawks very seldom soar
if they are sharp-set, and have had the chance of a bath most
fine days. It is from nine to four o&rsquo;clock in summer that there
is the most risk of it; and hobbies, which are greatly addicted
to the habit, should not be flown during these hours in fine
weather, unless the owner is prepared to wait twenty minutes,
or even longer, for my lord or my lady to finish airing herself
in the sky. Very special care must be taken of all hawks
during the migration season&mdash;that is, for some weeks after the
latter part of September and the beginning of April. At the
former period, indeed, it is barely safe to let hobbies wait on
at all; and the steadiest peregrines and merlins are apt to
feel more or less strongly the restlessness born of migratory
instincts. Many favourite hawks which seemed a few days
ago to be as safe as tame cats, have been known at migrating
time to develop quite suddenly an ungovernable wish to travel,
and have cleared for foreign parts when they had an opportunity,
without a moment&rsquo;s warning or a word of leave-taking.</p>

<p>Each hawk, after flying to the lure, will be immediately
fed up, usually on the way back to the hawk-house or the lawn.
As a rule, the earlier a hawk can be fed up the better, for she
will be the sooner ready for the field on the next day. Moreover,
she will fly better, probably, to the lure if she is aware that
that ordeal is often the precursor of a solid meal. The rather
common practice of feeding all the hawks at about the same
hour&mdash;generally late in the day&mdash;has nothing that I ever heard
of to recommend it. How can a hawk which habitually dines
at six o&rsquo;clock or later be expected to be keen or to fly well
when thrown off at her quarry at three or four o&rsquo;clock? If a
peregrine, when it has been finally decided not to fly her in the
field that day, is fed at about eleven o&rsquo;clock, she will be fit to
fly on the morrow at any time after noon. The falconer should
note in what order his hawks are fed, so that on the next day,
unless any special circumstances prevent it, those which have
been fasting the longest should be flown the first.</p>

<p>No hawk, after being fed up, should be disturbed, frightened,
or shaken about. If the return journey from the field or exercise-ground
is long, and the hawk inclined to bate off the fist,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">« 180 »</a></span>
she should be hooded just before or after she has finished her
meal; and on returning home she should be put in a quiet place&mdash;either
on a block where nothing can interfere with her, or on
the screen-perch; and if given to bating off, she should remain
hooded, or else in a darkened room, till nightfall. No hawk
should be allowed ever to finish her meal within sight of another
that is still hungry, or to be in a place where she can see a lure
or any sort of food without being able to get at it. At no time
should a hawk be pegged out in a position where she is exposed
to a strong wind, or to a hot sun, except just before and for a
while after her bath. Never should food be dragged or pulled
away forcibly from a hawk, leaving her hungry on the fist or
perch with nothing to eat. The falconer must play the part
of a friend, and of a generous friend, not of a niggardly and
tyrannical master, who makes use of his superior strength to
rob his servant of the good things which she expected to enjoy.</p>

<p>In summer, when the weather is fine and the ground tolerably
dry, peregrines, hobbies, and some of the hardiest of the big
hawks may be left all night at their blocks on the grass. But
the advantages, if any, resulting from such a plan are, I think,
more than questionable. It is argued, of course, that wild hawks
sleep in the open air, and therefore why not trained ones?
But the wild hawk chooses his or her resting-place&mdash;almost
always a tall tree or rock&mdash;far out of reach of the dews and
mists which belong to the grass and the lower air. If the wild
hawk gets wet, or feels cold at midnight, she has only the elements
or herself to blame. If the trained hawk suffers, will she not
blame the man who tied her down in a position where she could
not escape from these discomforts? A perfectly clean and well-aired
hawk-house is, to my mind, as good a place for hawks
to sleep in as the finest lawn on the fairest night of the year.
What good does a hawk get from bating at the block on to the
wet grass from 3 or 4 a.m. till the falconer appears? If wild
hawks did this, instead of keeping aloft in the clear air, would
they not be likely sometimes to get the croaks?</p>

<p>I have reserved till as late a place as this the question of
dieting, the most difficult, if not the most important, part of the
falconer&rsquo;s art. Condition in a trained hawk, as in a trained
horse or hound, is the most essential requisite for really great
success. Without it the very best hawk will make but a poor
show; and with it even a naturally slow hawk can be flown
with pleasure and credit. Condition must always depend
chiefly upon two things, exercise and dieting. Now, as regards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">« 181 »</a></span>
exercise, it is impossible for a falconer to err on the side of
excess. Wild hawks in their airy circlings, and in pursuit of
their daily subsistence, traverse an almost incredible distance
in the course of a year; probably fifty times as many miles as
the most active of trained hawks can be expected to travel in
the same period. Let the trainer, therefore, make it a simple
rule to give his charges as much exercise as he can&mdash;not all at
racing pace, of course, but in using their wings. He need not be
afraid of overdoing the thing, as long as he leaves off when the
hawk has made too violent an exertion in an actual flight at
quarry. I have seen a hobby, waiting on in a high wind, refuse
to come down to the lure, though quite sharp-set, and, for the
mere pleasure of flying, remain on the wing for twenty-five
minutes. The distance flown through the air in the time&mdash;counting
only that in which his head was to the wind&mdash;amounted
to a great many miles; and so far was he from being tired at
any time, that he would stoop at and hit the lure, and yet refuse
to hold it, and go up again to the soar. Few hawks will do
this willingly; they must often be induced by some device of
the trainer to keep on the wing; and it is impossible to fly such
hawks too much.</p>

<p>With respect to food, the matter is altogether different. It
is just as easy to overfeed a hawk as to underfeed her. But
what trainer can ever be sure that he has always exactly hit off
the golden mean? Gers, peregrines, and all the hawks which
resemble the peregrine, desert-hawks, hobbies, eagles, goshawks,
and female sparrow-hawks, are fed, as a rule, once a day&mdash;peregrines
well; eagles, goshawks, and the desert-hawks more
sparingly. Merlins of both sexes and male sparrow-hawks
twice; but lightly on one at least of the two occasions. Raw
beef is generally the staple food of the big hawks; but it should
not be tough, and should be often varied by a rather lighter
diet of bullock&rsquo;s heart, rabbit, fowl, or pigeon. Merlins and
sparrow-hawks should be fed chiefly on small birds, and in
default of these on sheep&rsquo;s heart, rabbit, young fowls, or exceedingly
tender mutton or beef. This sort of diet will also
be good for hobbies and kestrels; but it is not necessary to be
so nice with them, and they can be regaled with coarser food,
as long as it is not tough. But they must also have a freshly-killed
small bird occasionally. Goshawks will thrive upon rats,
weasels, squirrels, rooks, and, in short, almost any kind of bird
or animal, except water-hens, which are indigestible and apt to
bring them out of yarak. But a goshawk in good flying order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">« 182 »</a></span>
should not be kept for long upon coarse food, but indulged
now and then at least with viands of the best quality. Mice
are capital food, not only for kestrels and hobbies, but for
merlins and sparrow-hawks, and may be given whole to any
kind of hawk by way of castings. Eagles are not particular as
to diet; but they should have plenty of tirings, and their meat
will be none the worse for being a bit tough.</p>

<p>Eagles and all short-winged hawks should have a gorge,
that is to say, as much as they choose to eat, about three times
in a fortnight, and on the following day should be very sparingly
fed. Eagles, indeed, and some female goshawks need not be
fed at all, if they are to be flown at wild quarry on the second
day after their full meal. But none of the smaller hawks will
stand anything approaching to starvation; and to leave a male
sparrow-hawk or merlin without food for twenty-four hours
would probably do him a permanent injury, or at all events
ruin his chance of doing himself any justice in the field for a
long time to come. In the case of these, and indeed all the
long-winged hawks, when in constant exercise at wild quarry,
I am not quite sure that any good is done by giving any gorges
at all. I never do so with merlins in the lark season; and yet
I have killed with one of them over thirty larks in succession
without a miss. Granting that in their wild state all
hawks occasionally gorge themselves, it must be remembered
that trained hawks are not in a wild state. The analogy is not
a just or true one, any more than it would be to argue from
the habits of Red Indians to those expedient for a white man
in training. However, there can be no great harm, even if there
is no great advantage, in giving a gorge to a peregrine once a
week. It is a practice consecrated by old tradition and precept:
and it is not for us degenerate modern amateurs to lightly
discard the maxims of the age of chivalry.</p>

<p>In saying that peregrines and other big hawks are fed once
a day, it is not meant that they should never taste a morsel of
food except their one solid meal. Small tit-bits will be forthcoming
at odd times, as for instance in the early morning, when
they are moved from the perch to the block, or taken to bathe,
or to be carried. They will pick a little from the tirings at
which they are almost every day set to work. There is no
need to be stingy with these odds-and-ends; indeed, the old
falconers would very often give their falcons quite a small
meal when they hooded up for the field, or a little before. One
ancient writer declares that a falcon will eat the wing of a fowl,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">« 183 »</a></span>
and two hours afterwards be quite fit to fly. Another recommends
his readers always to feed eyess peregrines twice a day,
but of course moderately. The exact amount of food which it
is proper to give to each hawk cannot be specified even very
approximately. For amongst the same class of hawks, nay,
amongst hawks which actually came from the same nest, will
be found individuals with quite different sorts of appetites.
One of them will grow too thin upon rations that make her
sister, or even her brother, too fat. Nevertheless, taking the
average of a number of hawks of the same species, it is possible
to arrive at a rough estimate of what is usually required. The
allowance always prescribed for a peregrine falcon is one-third
of a pound of beef. Tiercels, therefore, will require about a
quarter of a pound; and other English hawks must be provided
for on about the same scale, <i>i.e.</i> the amount of food, if very solid,
should weigh nearly one-seventh of the total weight of the bird
fed. The desert-hawks, however, are much smaller feeders. A
saker, for instance, looks about as large as a gerfalcon. But it
was computed that a trained ger would eat three times as much
as a saker. The power of fasting of these hawks is naturally
very great; and they should have great gorges, with intervals of
very spare feeding. On the other hand, the small hawks eat a
great deal more in proportion to their size than the large ones.
A whole skylark, of average dimensions, given freshly killed,
with all the blood warm in it, is not quite enough for a merlin&rsquo;s
daily ration, but would be about right for most jacks. The
ladies, when doing hard work, require about four larks in three
days. A starling or blackbird is about the right daily meal for
a female hobby, but rather too little for a female sparrow-hawk,
and decidedly too much for a &ldquo;musket&rdquo; or &ldquo;robin.&rdquo; A sparrow
without its feathers weighs an ounce, as nearly as may be; and
two whole sparrows a day is a very ample allowance for a merlin,
even when flying both morning and evening. Probably
this would be about the fair quantity to keep a female hobby
in good condition. A sparrow and a half would be about
sufficient for a jack, a robin, or a musket. An ounce of beef is
of course a heavier meal than an ounce of sparrow, but it may
be doubted whether it will give a small hawk more strength or
courage, though it will sustain him longer.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that the apportionment of food to each
individual hawk becomes a more difficult matter in proportion
as the hawk is smaller. A mistake of an ounce, one way or
the other, is no great matter in the case of a ger or a falcon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">« 184 »</a></span>
but give a jack-merlin an ounce too much or an ounce too little,
and you may very soon find out your mistake in a most practical
way. Sometimes a jack will eat more&mdash;and need more&mdash;than
his own sisters or any merlin in the establishment. Sometimes,
but more rarely, a single merlin will want nearly as much
as two jacks. Tiercel peregrines, barbarys, and others, sometimes,
but rarely, require almost as much as a falcon. A hawk
which has throughout her life never known what it is to be thin
can generally be kept in high condition on less food than one
which has once been below par. Fortunate is the man who has
been able to train his hawk without ever putting her on short
commons, and has always been able, by skill or luck, or both
combined, to fly her just at the time when she was keen enough
and yet not over-hungry. Such hawks have the best chance of
turning out well; and among them may probably be numbered
many of those whose names are glorious in the annals of the
sport.</p>

<p>A hawk&rsquo;s condition may be tested to a certain limited extent
by passing a finger down her breast-bone, and by feeling the
broad pectoral muscles on each side of the breast between the
forefinger and thumb. Some indications may also be got by
gently pinching the muscles of the leg, to ascertain whether
they are full and hard. But these are very rough tokens to judge
from. One hawk will fly her best when almost as fat as a wild
one, and when the sternum is hardly more prominent than it is
in a partridge; whereas others, when fed up to this condition,
will do no serious work, but go off soaring on their own account,
or take perch in a tree or rick, and stare unconcernedly at the
lure as if they had no conception that it had any attractions for
them. The experienced falconer will form a better judgment
as to the condition of his hawk from the manner in which she
flies. There is a power and ease of motion about a full-fleshed
hawk, a force in her stoop, and a sort of pride about her every
movement, which one looks for in vain in a hawk in poor condition.
Thin hawks fly in a laboured way against a strong
wind, instead of facing it easily and appearing to rejoice in
their victory over it, utilising its very opposition to lift them
up, and sailing on it like a stiff yacht in a gale. Weak flying
may result from overfeeding as well as underfeeding. But in the
one case the style appears too heavy; and in the other, too light.</p>

<p>It is, however, very easy to mistake the symptoms, and to
imagine that a hawk wants reducing when in fact she wants
feeding up. The result, of course, of such faulty diagnosis will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">« 185 »</a></span>
be that the treatment applied as a remedy aggravates the mischief
already done. It is much easier to reduce a hawk than
to get flesh on her again. The beginner should therefore be
very sure that his hawk has been overfed before he shortens her
daily supply of food. By making a mistake on the other side,
and feeding up a hawk which is already a bit above herself, the
worst inconvenience that is likely to follow, in the case of an
eyess, is a little delay in getting her down to the lure. Passage
hawks, especially for a while after they have first been reclaimed,
are of course liable to be lost if too highly fed, for when disinclined
to come to the lure or fist they are apt to rake away
after chance quarry. But they may be full-fleshed and strong,
and yet be eager for their food. It is a great mistake, though
a very common one, to suppose that a thin hawk is necessarily
a hungry one. Whether a hawk is fat or thin is a question of
days, whereas it is a question of hours whether she is hungry or
not. For instance, a peregrine may have had nearly a full crop
every day for a week, and yet if on the eighth day she has only
a very light feed in the morning she will be as hungry as a
hunter on the ninth day in the afternoon. The tendency nowadays
is rather to overfeed hawks, and to forget the old maxim
about a fat hawk making &ldquo;a lean horse and an empty purse.&rdquo;
The amateur has been so loudly warned against keeping a thin
hawk that in avoiding this reproach he falls into the other
extreme, and attempts to fly his hawk when she is really not
sharp-set at all.</p>

<p>Washed meat&mdash;so commonly used by the old falconers, that
it may almost be said to have been a normal daily diet&mdash;is now
but rarely given, unless, indeed, where a parsimonious or careless
owner has neglected to provide fresh meat, and tainted beef
is soaked and squeezed so as to make it available as food. The
proper mode of preparing washed meat is to take it when quite
fresh and immerse it for a while in cold water, and then dry it
in a warm place. Part of its nutritive power&mdash;of its goodness,
in fact&mdash;will then have disappeared, and what remains will digest
quickly, leaving the hawk more keen and sooner hungry than
if she had swallowed the same quantity of unwashed meat. For
the smaller hawks it is less suitable than for the larger; and if
it is desired to take them down a peg or two, it will generally
be found best either to resort to a diet naturally light, such as
rabbit or sheep&rsquo;s heart, or to reduce a little in quantity the
accustomed allowance of their usual food. When a merlin is a
bit bumptious, independent, and disobedient, her morning ration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">« 186 »</a></span>
may be curtailed, or in feeding up after the day&rsquo;s exercise she
may be indulged only with a good half-crop, instead of the
habitual three-quarters. When a peregrine or hawk of similar
habits is inclined to be uppish, and to disdain the dead lure, it is
a good plan, besides being a shade stingy at dinner-time, to
fly her each day at least an hour later than the day before.
When, in this way, her time of flying has got to be so late that
it cannot be deferred till later on the following day, give her
a gorge, or at least a very full meal, when she has done flying,
and on the next day, an hour after she has cast, give her quite
a light feed, and do not fly her at all till the day after at
noon. Sakers, lanners, and that class of hawks must be rather
sternly treated if they get above themselves, for their nature is
to support long fasts without much trouble. And eagles, of
course, must sometimes be almost starved a little.</p>

<p>Remember always that the food given to a trained hawk
belongs to one or other of several categories, which rank differently
as regards nutritive power. Highest on the list is the flesh
of birds or other animals eaten immediately after they are killed,
while the life-blood is still warm within them. The meals of
wild hawks are, as a rule, of this description; and these accordingly,
by virtue of their diet, as well as of their habits, are the
most vigorous and healthy of all. Next in order comes the
flesh of such creatures as have been killed long enough to grow
cold. And in the last rank must be placed washed meat&mdash;artificially
reduced to its least nutritive character. When it is
desired to improve the condition of a hawk, food of the first
class will most quickly and most surely effect the object. Any
hawk which is found to be below par should have at the first
opportunity at least one &ldquo;bloody crop,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> should either be
allowed to take her pleasure on some quarry which she has herself
killed, or be indulged with a pigeon, duck, fowl, or other
animal which has just been killed. The flesh of animals, whether
freshly killed or not, differs a good deal in quality. Pigeons,
duck, plovers, and sparrows are about the most nourishing;
chickens, rabbits, quails, larks, and mice, somewhat less so. The
flesh of rooks, gulls, magpies, water-hens, and coots is not very
palatable; and some trained hawks will not touch it. None
are likely to improve in condition if fed upon it. There is
nothing a trained hawk likes better than good tender beef,
especially if it is slightly warmed before being given. It is also
very sustaining, and will increase a hawk&rsquo;s weight rapidly, when
a generous allowance of it is made. It is, however, much heavier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">« 187 »</a></span>
and more solid than the natural food of any hawk, and therefore
apt, if freely given, to make her dull, slow, and sluggish. For
sparrow-hawks and merlins it is distinctly bad, if often taken,
and in large quantities at a time. These latter, when in flying
order at the right season of the year, are, of course, almost
always fed up in the field on the quarry they have last killed
before finishing their day&rsquo;s work, and the next morning have a
few mouthfuls of similar food which has been killed the afternoon
before. When a rook-hawk will readily feed up in the
same way on her vanquished quarry, it will be convenient, occasionally
at least, to let her do so. Game-hawks should also be
allowed sometimes to take their pleasure on their own grouse,
partridge, pheasant, or even woodcock; but in practice they are
seldom lucky enough to get more than the heads and necks,
though modern falconers who fly mostly for sport, and not &ldquo;for
the pot,&rdquo; are often more liberal in this respect than their predecessors
of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Goshawks, when kept to hares, or indeed to any quarry
which taxes their utmost powers, should often be allowed to
finish their meal on one of their victims. Between whiles they
may often with advantage be regaled with washed meat only,
or some not very appetising food. It is well to induce all hawks
to believe that a kill after a hard flight means an extra good
feast. But merlins and male sparrow-hawks must very seldom,
if at all, know the taste of washed meat, or of any third-rate
diet. Some of them, when in first-rate fettle, are very dainty,
and will lose the pink of their condition if not indulged with
their favourite food. These little hawks are exceedingly fond
of swallows and some other very small birds; and although few
people would be barbarous enough to deliberately kill any small
bird except a sparrow, yet if a young martin should be picked
up under the nest from which it has accidentally fallen, and
given to a merlin, it will be odd if that hawk does not fly
unusually well when next put on the wing. In the lark-hawking
season, one of these active workers will not only keep herself
in food, but often supply enough extra victims to provide a
daily meal of the very best kind for a tiercel, or even a falcon,
which happens then to be in moult. The short-winged hawks
will also sometimes in one afternoon kill more than they could
themselves eat in a week.</p>

<p>A not unimportant item of the commissariat is a supply of
good tirings. A tiring may consist of anything tough which is
appetising enough for a hawk to keep pulling and picking at it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">« 188 »</a></span>
to satisfy her hunger. For tiercels and all hawks of about the
same size, rabbits&rsquo; or leverets&rsquo; feet, with the lower part of the
leg, make capital tirings. So do the necks of fowls and ducks,
which a falconer should always cause to be reserved for him
when any poultry is slain for the kitchen. The foot of an old
hare is not too tough for a strong falcon. The small hawks will
generally be kept employed for a good many minutes by the
two outer joints of a duck&rsquo;s or old pigeon&rsquo;s wing. These tirings
should be given whenever a hawk is short of exercise, or fidgety
on the block or perch. Their effect is not only to strengthen
all the muscles&mdash;for it is quite hard work picking the scanty
scraps of food off the bones and skin amongst which they lie hid&mdash;but
also to engross the attention of the hawk, which would
otherwise very possibly be pining more or less sadly for freedom,
and often jumping off in the vain endeavour to attain to that
blessing. The frequent picking of bones also keeps a hawk&rsquo;s
beak from growing down at the point to an unnatural length.
A man who tells you that he often has to cope his hawk stands
detected of being in the habit of not giving her sufficient tirings.
Another most valuable use of these tough morsels has been
already referred to. It is discovered during the first period of
manning the hawk, when the necessary job of carrying is found
to be ten times more agreeable and better performed if, while
the pupil has perforce to stand on the fist, she has some inducement
to do so in the shape of a fowl&rsquo;s &ldquo;drumstick&rdquo; or the wing
of a goose, off which almost all the meat has already been picked.
No better advice is given by Mr. Freeman&mdash;though every one of
his counsels is admirable&mdash;than to prolong as much as possible
the meals which a half-trained hawk takes on the fist. Often
the delicacy on which you are regaling her will be tender in one
part and tough in another. For instance, it may be the full-fleshed
leg of some fowl, off which the meat can easily be torn,
with a part of the back, consisting chiefly of skin and bone. If
your rather shy pupil takes kindly to the least manageable part
of her appointed dinner, let her pick at it, and laboriously polish
with many applications of her beak the ill-covered bones of the
back, stroking her from time to time with a pencil or with the
right hand. Possibly she will not yet stand such acts of familiarity,
but bate off. When she is on the fist again, let her recommence
operations without taking any liberties with her. Reserve
your attentions with the stick for the time when she will be busy
discussing the more succulent morsels in the <i>menu</i>, and when
she is more likely to submit, without much protest, to the indignity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">« 189 »</a></span>
of being stroked. So also, while she is pulling contentedly
at the juiciest parts of the joint, you may take her more freely
into the presence of men, horses, dogs, and children&mdash;in fact,
introduce her to more society. The bolder you become the
more inclined she will be to let her mistrust prevail over her
fondness for the feast, and the less exclusively she will confine
her attention to it. Thus a pigeon&rsquo;s wing, which it would take
a fully-trained tiercel less than five minutes to dispose of, may,
with a falcon caught only a fortnight ago, engage her attention
for nearly half an hour.</p>

<p>With tirings there will often be a small quantity of castings
which will be swallowed with the pickings of meat. The trainer
must judge for himself whether enough of them has been thus
taken during the day to form a proper pellet, or whether more
should be given in another way. In feeding up upon quarry which
they have themselves killed, whether on the fist or on the ground,
hawks will almost always naturally take castings enough. But
when the meal consists of beef, or of anything that has been
skinned or plucked quite bare, it will be necessary either to add
some feathers or fur, or the like, scattering it about on the meat
which the hawk is about to swallow, or else the casting may
consist of a strip of skin with fur or feathers left on it, and a
piece of meat at one end. While swallowing the meat the hawk
will gulp down the skin attached to it, and thus with one or two
mouthfuls give herself the required quantity of castings. Some
falconers make up the casting into a sort of pill, and cram their
hawks with it; and I believe this plan answers the purpose very
well, though I have seldom if ever tried it. It is not, of course,
necessary to give castings every day. But they are generally
beneficial, and always, as far as I know, harmless. Some of the
old falconers advise not to give castings on days when a hawk
has bathed; but I am unable to give the reason for this. Castings
are taken daily by wild hawks, which certainly have less
need of them than tame ones. And if, through laziness or any
other cause, the falconer omits for days in succession to give any,
it is pretty certain that his hawk&rsquo;s crop and stomach will become
clogged with a sort of mucus, which will either make her dull,
sluggish, and morose, or otherwise impair her general health.
Castings should be given rather late in the day than early; and
after they have been taken the hawk must always be kept
unhooded at about the time when she may be expected to throw
them up, <i>i.e.</i> from about the fifth hour after she has swallowed
the casting, until she has cast. For this reason, if for no other,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">« 190 »</a></span>
when it is intended to train passage hawks in any place, it must
always be possible to darken artificially a part of the room, so
that hawks can sit there bareheaded on the perch after castings
have been given.</p>

<p>Another article which may in a sense be included in the
category of diet, is one which will somewhat surprise the reader
who has heard nothing about falconry before. This is &ldquo;rangle,&rdquo;
which is nothing more nor less than small stones or pebbles,
swallowed after the manner of castings, and with a similar
purpose and effect. After being taken into the crop these
exceedingly indigestible delicacies&mdash;popularly supposed to be
dear to ostriches only&mdash;collect around themselves by some
special process of attraction a quantity of that same mucus
which is apt to accumulate in a hawk&rsquo;s internal organism.
When afterwards they are thrown up&mdash;for not even the greediest
goshawk will actually assimilate stones&mdash;they come up with
this oily coating adhering to them, having operated as a sort of
emetic, without any of the disagreeable concomitants of physicking
with drugs. Why the purpose for which rangle is given
cannot be as effectually accomplished by simple castings of
feather or fur, I am afraid I cannot explain ; but these latter
do not appear to be able to clear the hawk&rsquo;s inside of the particular
kind of superfluous humours which are extracted by the
harder substance. Possibly the weight of pebbles causes them
to descend farther into the crop, and thus clear it more thoroughly
than any such light material as can be given by way of castings.
For the small hawks rangle may be given by scattering a few
pinches of rather fine gravel on the meat at which they are
picking. It is a good plan also to scatter about, close to the
blocks of any hawks for which a dose of this kind is thought
good, a few stones of a round smooth shape, varying in size
from that of a horse-bean for a falcon, to that of a sweet-pea seed
for a jack-merlin. The patient often knows instinctively when
such a dose is likely to do her good, and swallows one or more
of the stones voluntarily. If she does not, and it is thought
advisable that she should be dosed whether she likes it or not,
the hawk may be cast, and the tasteless pill slipped into her
mouth, and pushed down with a small stick. Latham, who
was a great stickler for rangle, tells a quaint story of a hawk
which he owned. He stuffed her with sixteen stones, which
she threw up in due course. The stones were picked up and
washed, and put down again near the hawk&rsquo;s block on the following
evening. And every day for a month successively this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">« 191 »</a></span>
very accommodating hawk voluntarily picked up and swallowed
some dozen of the stones, which were daily collected, washed,
and put down again. When a hawk, after moulting, is taken
out, or &ldquo;drawn,&rdquo; as the old writers call it, from the mews, it is
generally beneficial to give her rangle. Hack hawks, when
taken up, are often all the better for it; and when a hawk seems
dull, or displays dyspeptic symptoms, she may not unfrequently
be cured off-hand by the same simple expedient.</p>

<p>Every evening the falconer, having fed up all his hawks (and
possibly himself) and noted down in his register what has been
killed or done by each of them, should collect all the bodies or
pelts of the slain which have not been used as food, and bestow
them in a separate place in his larder, so that the results of one
day&rsquo;s campaigning may not get mixed up with those of a
previous day, and it may be known how long each unfortunate
has been killed. In hot weather no small bird, and very few
other things, are fit to be given to a hawk if they have been
dead more than twenty-four hours. In the tropics, of course,
meat goes bad still more quickly; and at about tiffin-time
everything which has been killed earlier than on the same day
should be cleared out of the hawks&rsquo; larder. If the falconer
can get to roost soon after his charges he will think himself
fortunate. For the making up of his diary is, on busy days,
quite a business in itself. Then it is possible that some
accident has occurred. If there has been a broken feather, the
damaged hawk must be imped. If one is amiss, measures
must be taken for applying the proper remedies. If a jess is
worn, it must be replaced. But the worst trouble is if a hawk
has been left out. Then the wretched falconer must make up
his mind to set forth before daybreak on a long and weary
search. But of these pains and griefs, to which the poor man
may always be a victim, we shall have to speak in future
chapters.</p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Hawks in the Field</span></p>


<p>Half an hour or so before the time appointed for starting
to the field, the falconer will begin to hood up those
hawks which are to be taken out. Each of them, if in proper
order, will jump from the block or the perch to his fist as soon
as he extends it within reach. For some of them it will be a
very simple matter to slip on a hood; and without further ado
they will be placed on the cadge and the leash made fast to it.
Others which have only lately completed their training, or
which have not yet quite mastered a dislike to the hood, may
be first indulged by the production of a tiring, and before or just
after they begin to pull at it may be hooded with such dexterity
as the operator can boast of. A good hooder is also a quick
hooder; but nothing is more likely to make a man bungle his
business than to set about it in a hurry at the last moment, just
before it is time to start.</p>

<p>The cadge, if a cadge is to be taken out, being placed in a
sheltered spot, with its occupants ranged along it and safely
attached, all the requisite paraphernalia to be carried must be
properly stowed away either in some vehicle or in the falconer&rsquo;s
pouches or pockets. For every person who is to take any active
part in the day&rsquo;s proceedings, it will be well to have a lure which
he can easily carry. Each such man should also reserve at least
one pocket, unless he wears a pouch, in which he can put a
spare hood and a spare leash. When it is expected that a live
lure may be required, the bird which is to serve the purpose
should be accommodated with comfortable quarters in which he
cannot be shaken or knocked about, or be cramped or short of
air. The man who carries the cadge must be instructed or
reminded as to his duties&mdash;how to set down the cadge under the
lee of a rick or fence or other shelter, and, having done so, to keep
his eyes open, and act as a marker. Some code of signals may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">« 193 »</a></span>
generally be agreed upon for informing the cadge man from a
distance when he is to go forward with his burden and in what
direction. If the party is to include any people who have never
been out hawking before, they should be warned as to running
or riding in, and requested to stand still whenever a rook or
other quarry makes towards them as a shelter from the stoop.
The falconer himself should carry a spare leash and hood or
two, some string which can be unwound quickly without kinking,
and a supply of small coins wherewith to reward farm-labourers
or other rustics who, in case of a lost hawk, may give
useful information. He should also have a field-block or two,
or at least some pegs for pegging down a hawk by her leash,
and a certain provision of food for feeding up hawks which may
have failed to kill anything, or which are not to be allowed to
regale themselves upon the quarry which they may take.</p>

<p>If the place where the hawks are to be flown is close at
hand, and there are not more hawks to be taken out than there
are men to carry them, a cadge may sometimes be dispensed
with altogether, and the light blocks which have been described
as field-blocks can be brought instead, taking care that there are
enough of them for each hawk (except the one which is for the
time being about to be flown) to be supplied with one when it
is desired to put her down. In some cases the hawk or hawks
may even be taken out bareheaded, as for instance when three
merlins are carried by three men, each of whom knows how to
manage his part of the day&rsquo;s business. But in most cases where
more than two hawks have to be flown, it will be found best to
hood up all except the one which is first to be thrown off. For
a hawk which is bareheaded on the fist or on a field-block will
bate very much if she sees a flight is going on in which she cannot
take part. Moreover, the man who is carrying an unhooded
hawk cannot follow a flight freely in which another hawk is
engaged, and, after assisting at the start, finds himself obliged
to see hawk and quarry sail away out of sight, while compelled
to stand almost still, rendering no service even as a marker,
and left in the lurch, with a toilsome walk or ride before him,
which very possibly he may not accomplish before another
flight starts, in which he will have even less part or lot.</p>

<p>In every kind of hawking the marshalling of the field is a
most important matter; so much so that success or failure sometimes
depends upon the manner in which the quarry has been
walked up or approached. For instance, in the pursuit of rooks,
gulls, and larks, the chances of a kill are comparatively remote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">« 194 »</a></span>
if the quarry is down-wind when the hawk is thrown off. On the
other hand, in game-hawking, the pursuer has a much better
chance if the first stoop is made down-wind. Consequently, in
beating for grouse or partridges, the falconer will start proceedings
from the windward edge of his country, and keep the
game, as far as he can, always down-wind of his line of beaters;
whereas in the other cases the hawking party will begin to leeward,
and proceed as nearly as possible with their faces to the
wind. In other words, a hawk flown from the fist should be
flown up-wind at her quarry, and one which waits on should
start down-wind at it. So well established is this principle that
when a rook is espied on the ground to leeward, a whole party
of mounted men will sometimes make a circuit of a mile in
length, in order to make sure of getting the wind of him and
giving the falcon a fair chance. When there is anything of a
wind, it is advisable for a lark-hawker, after making a beat to
windward, to return on his own tracks, with what is called a
dead beat, and start afresh on another march parallel to the
first, so as to avoid putting up a lark while walking in the wrong
direction, and being reduced to the alternative of either letting
the merlin go on a sort of fool&rsquo;s errand, or disappointing and
vexing her by holding on to the jesses when she jumps off.</p>

<p>The posting of markers is a matter requiring some skill and
care, even in the case where the falconer is well acquainted with
his country. It will be found of the greatest possible advantage
to have plenty of markers, especially where, as is often the
case in game-hawking, all or most of the men are unmounted.
Before beginning to try the ground, the falconer should detach
men or boys to post themselves down-wind in positions where
they can command the most extensive view, and, as it were,
guard the approaches to any covert for which the quarry is likely
to make. Often it can be predicted with tolerable certainty
which plantation a rook or lark will choose as his place of
refuge, or at which thick hedge or piece of tall roots or of standing
crops a partridge will try to put in. Often, of course, there are
two or more spinnies or sheltering-places, either of which may
attract the fugitive. If these places are within sight of any
marker with a good pair of eyes, he will be able to tell the first
comer-up whether the flight ended in either of them, or went on
in another direction. Without such information much valuable
time may be wasted in searching a covert where neither hawk
nor quarry is to be found. Markers are more useful down-wind
than up. For in all long flights where the quarry takes the air,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">« 195 »</a></span>
he is pretty sure, when hard pressed, to turn in that direction,
whilst in game-hawking it is always the object of the beaters to
drive the birds down-wind. Any marker, upon seeing a kill or a
put-in, should note as accurately as he can the exact spot, and
then stand still at his post until he can communicate with one
of the field. In open country all markers should remain at a
distance of about half a mile from the man carrying the hawk
to be flown, and should shift their position rapidly to another
vantage-ground whenever the space between them and the
hawking party is much diminished or increased.</p>

<p>In rook-hawking the lookers-on must be mounted; and their
horses ought either to be very sure-footed or else well acquainted
with the ground on which the flights take place, which is often
covered with ant-hills, and in places bored by rabbit burrows.
If the rider is to see anything of the longest and best flights,
his horse must be able to step out in a gallop of a mile or
so. In game- and lark-hawking it is less necessary, and often
impossible, for the men to be mounted; but in these cases also
it is of very great advantage for at least one man to ride, so
that he may follow a very long flight with a better chance
of keeping the hawk in view. The horseman has a double
advantage when the country is uneven. He can go faster, and
he can also from his place in the saddle see farther over the
brow of a hill or undulation. But ground which undulates in
long ridges and valleys is to be mistrusted by falconers. When
a flight, commenced in one valley, goes over the ridge which
separates it from the next, it is impossible, unless there is a
marker on that ridge, to know where it may have ended. Here
the falconer, for once in his life, may hope that the ground on
the other side is not too open, and that there may be some
small covert not far off in which the quarry is pretty sure to
have stopped if he got so far. When a hawk goes out of sight
over a ridge, the men following on horseback should begin to
spread out like a fan, and ride on, keeping a good look-out for
anything that may indicate the direction which the flight has
taken.</p>

<p>When a flight ends successfully, every person in the field
should halt at a hundred yards or so from the place where the
hawk is on the ground with the quarry in her foot. The
falconer, or whoever it was that threw off the hawk, will use his
own judgment as to when he will make in and take her up, and
must go alone about this business, which, as we have seen, is
sometimes delicate enough. Although it is an unpardonable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">« 196 »</a></span>
mistake to make in too quickly, so as to alarm the hawk, yet it
is not wise to defer too long the business of taking up. For it
is always possible that a stray dog may rush in, or some other
accident occur which may frighten the hawk just at the time
when you most wish to save her from any such alarm.</p>

<p>If for any reason you wish your hawk to eat her quarry
where she has killed, attach the leash to her jesses and to a peg
in the ground, or to a field-block, leaving a man to watch her
and keep a sharp look-out against intruders. Although in the
very open country, where alone the long-winged hawks ought
to be flown, there are not many interlopers in the shape of stray
dogs or tourists, yet it is wonderful how, with a little bad
luck at his heels, the falconer may be annoyed by unexpected
intruders. I well remember a valuable hawk being lost on
Salisbury Plain, not far from Stonehenge, by the appearance on
the scene of an object which one would hardly expect to see
there, three miles from the nearest village. The hawk, which
was a bit shy to take up, was discussing a well-earned meal
upon a heap of stones by the side of a cart-road, when along
this road came a nurse-maid with a gaudy-hooded perambulator.
She got past the hawk, but not without exciting a
large share of its attention. Unfortunately, however, she caught
sight of the falconers hurrying up, and then of the hawk, and
with that feeling of curiosity which seems to be strongly
developed in the genus nurse-maid, turned the perambulator
round, and began wheeling it straight towards the hawk. This
was altogether too much for the latter. Convinced that some
deadly mischief lurked in the strange machine approaching, she
picked up the remains of her quarry, and, taking it off with her,
could not be afterwards approached.</p>

<p>Only when the falconer is seen to have secured the victorious
hawk, and attached the leash to her jesses, is it permitted to the
field to go up. When time is precious, and there are a lot of
hawks to be flown, the line of march may proceed, leaving the
work of taking up the successful hawk to him who flew her;
and when the next quarry is put up, the next hawk in order
may be thrown off by the man who carries her. Otherwise it
is best to get one flight altogether done with before another is
started. When the quarry has beaten off his pursuers and got
away, a lure or lures must be put in requisition; and one man,
if he can be spared, should remain, with lure in hand, near the
place where the hawk, if out of sight, was last seen. The others
will follow on, more or less quickly, in the direction she seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">« 197 »</a></span>
to take. All trained hawks have a certain inclination to return
after an unsuccessful chase towards the place from which they
started in pursuit; and the man to whom the easy duty of
standing still is allotted generally has as good a chance of
taking up such a hawk as any one of those who have walked
or ridden forward.</p>

<p>When the quarry puts in, and the place is known or shrewdly
guessed at, generally all the field may participate more or less
directly in the work of getting him out. In magpie- and blackbird-hawking,
this routing out of the quarry is one of the most
animated parts of the day&rsquo;s proceedings. But everything must
be done under the control and direction of the head falconer.
An amateur may do more harm than good, nay, may spoil the
whole job and disgust the hawk, by blundering on and driving
out the half-vanquished fugitive in a wrong direction, or at an
ill-chosen moment. The falconer himself learns by long experience
many of the little ways of birds that have put in&mdash;on
which side of a fence they will most likely be found; whether
inside a hedge or in the long grass or weeds outside it; which
way his head is likely to be turned; and whether he may be
expected to jump up readily at a man&rsquo;s first appearance, or to
sit still and allow himself to be taken up in the hand or kicked
up with the foot. After a hard flight, in which he was getting
much the worst of it, the latter is a likely event; whereas if the
hawk was making a poor show, and did not press him hard, he
will be more ready to start again with fresh hopes of escape.</p>

<p>Some judgment is sometimes required to decide whether in
any particular case it is advisable to drive out quarry which has
put in, or to pick him up with the hand, if he will allow this,
or to leave him alone altogether. This last alternative is not
so unlikely to be preferable as a beginner might imagine.
Suppose, for instance, that a very good rook, after a hard flight
with a young falcon, has managed to get to a small tree which
stands by itself, at a distance of a quarter of a mile or less
from a wood or big plantation. The hawk waits on, but rather
wide. By sending a boy up into the tree, you think you may
most likely get the rook out. Will you do so, or leave him
alone, and take down the falcon to the lure? If you rout the
rook out, it is about ten to one that he will get safe to the big
covert. The hawk, if at all wide when he makes his attempt,
will hardly have time in so short a distance to make even one
stoop, and far less a fatal one. You will have disappointed her,
and perhaps disgusted her greatly with the job of flying at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">« 198 »</a></span>
rooks, never the most attractive of quarry. Many a good
falconer will prefer to call down the hawk, and, leaving the
rook to congratulate himself on his escape, reserve her for a
fresh start at a quarry which she will have a fairer chance of
catching. In lark-hawking, unless the country is extremely
open, cases of this kind often present themselves.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if there is a really good prospect of a
successful flight when the fugitive is routed out, it is, of course,
very encouraging to the hawk to put him up. Every effort
should be made to do this when the hawk is waiting on in a
good position, so that, having killed, she may be pleased with
the whole performance, including the men&rsquo;s share in it, and may
perhaps imagine that the reason the quarry was got out so conveniently
for her was because she waited on well. Hawks,
whether waiting on in the air or at perch in a good place, soon
get to know very well what the men are about when hunting up
a bird that has put in. In the case of merlins, which naturally
stand by on the ground while a lark is being searched for, it is
almost always better to take them up on the fist as soon as it is
determined to pick up or try to capture the quarry. Otherwise
the lark, having his wits about him, may take advantage of a
moment when the hawk is looking the wrong way, and slip off
unseen by her. Moreover, even if she sees him go, she will not
start from the ground with so good a chance as from the elevation,
small though it is, of your fist. As for sparrow-hawks and
goshawks, they may, when a quarry puts in, either be called to
the hand or allowed to wait close by at the standpoint which
they themselves chose. Many of them prefer the latter plan
whenever there is a tree handy, as from it they get a better view
and more impetus for their stoop. Lanners, when flown at
partridges in an enclosed country, may also be encouraged to
go to perch in this way.</p>

<p>There are some occasions when it is quite permissible to
capture with the hand a bird which has put in. Suppose that you
are carrying a first-rate merlin which is short of work and for
which you are particularly anxious to find hard flights and
plenty of them. Now, when a lark gets up which is either so
young or so deep in the moult that he cannot live long in the
air before such a merlin, you are in presence of that very
eventuality which you most wished to avoid. There is the
prospect of a quick and easy kill, which is about the least likely
thing in the world to encourage a hawk to a severe flight afterwards.
The best that you can hope for is that the lark, seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">« 199 »</a></span>
his inferiority, as he is sure to do,&mdash;for all wild birds are very
good judges of such a matter,&mdash;will flop down in front of the
hawk&mdash;or just behind her, if the first stoop has been avoided&mdash;in
some place where there is just enough covert for the hawk to
be unable to espy and jump upon him. Then, when you come
up, the lark, which knows as well as you do what fate awaits
him if he gets up again, will be very likely indeed to let you
seize him in your hand. Will you, then, let that bad lark go
before that good merlin? Not if you have any wish to keep up
or improve the excellence of the latter. If you have in the
background an inferior hawk to enter, or to encourage after an
unsuccessful flight, you may start her at the captured lark,
taking great care that she does not know that he has ever been
captured. Or you may consign him to a safe place where he
will not be damaged, and save him for a time when a bagged
lark may be of invaluable service to you as a live lure for a
lost hawk. Or what you will probably like best will be to let
him go when no merlin is by. Similar cases will occur with
other quarry and other hawks; but they are pretty frequent in
the case of larks, which at moulting-time differ more than any
other birds in their pluck and powers of flying.</p>

<p>When a hawk is new to the work of taking wild quarry she
should be allowed to kill it and to break in and eat at least
some part of it. But when she is <i>au fait</i> at the business the
humane man will often be glad if he can save the victim&rsquo;s life,
and this he will not unfrequently be able to do. Unless the
quarry has been struck on the head or has a wing broken, no
real damage is at all likely to have been done except in cases
where the particular hawk has a specially hard stoop of her
own, and is fond of cutting down her quarry instead of binding
to it. For herons, gulls, rooks, and larks, after they have
been taken, it is often pretty easy for the falconer, if he is up in
reasonable time, to substitute the pelt of another bird which has
been killed before. As I write this page I hear the singing of a
lark in a cage before me which was captured by Jubilee after a
long ringing flight, and saved from him while he was recovering
his wind.</p>

<p>When it is found necessary to get bagged larks for entering
a hobby&mdash;I have sometimes used one for entering merlins&mdash;they
may be obtained in this way. Stick two wattled hurdles into
the ground three inches apart and side by side in the middle
of a very big field where there are larks. Stuff up the space
between the two hurdles with loose straw, all except about a foot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">« 200 »</a></span>
at each end. Then take out a merlin and beat the field, driving
towards the hurdles. When a lark gets up, if the hawk presses
him hard, he will go to the shelter which is so inviting. Then
taking down your merlin, and giving her a tiring to amuse her,
go and pick out the lark from the straw near one end of the
hurdles.</p>

<p>I am aware that some writers&mdash;and those of the highest
authority&mdash;have recommended the use of bagged larks after
ringing flights when the quarry has put in and cannot quickly be
got out; and that the plan is advocated especially in the case of
merlins flown at larks. I venture to think, however, that it is a
plan which must be resorted to with very great discretion, and
only in extreme cases. The idea, of course, is that the bagged
bird, let loose at the place where the wild one was seen to put
in, is mistaken for the latter by the hawk, which consequently
supposes when she has killed that her victim is the one at which
she first started. But does the hawk ever make this mistake?
A lark, for instance, which has flown a ringing flight is necessarily
a good one, whereas the bagged one&mdash;unless by a rare
accident you have picked one up just before&mdash;is necessarily a poor
one and generally a bad one; especially if he has been dragged
about in a bag or box for an hour or more. Will the merlin
believe that this third- or fourth-rate performer is the same bird
which a few minutes ago took her up after him into the clouds?
Would you yourself, if you had chased a pickpocket or a
welsher for half a mile, mistake his identity five minutes
afterwards? And the difference between a good and a bad
lark is much greater than the difference between a good and a
bad pickpocket!</p>

<p>There are several other objections to letting bagged quarry
go as personating the real. For instance, a bad lark is generally
taken in the air, and taken easily; and with a lark so taken
merlins almost always fly a good way before coming down with
them to the ground. There is then the risk of not being able
to find them; and at anyrate the hawk has learnt how easy it is
to carry her quarry,&mdash;a species of knowledge which it is a main
object of the falconer not to let her acquire. Of course a light
creance may be attached to the bagged bird, and the carrying
prevented, but this aggravates the dissimilarity between the
sham quarry and the one which was put in. On the whole,
considering the difficulties of carrying bagged quarry about,
and producing them at the right moment in the right place,
I doubt if, in the moulting season at all events, it is wise to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">« 201 »</a></span>
attempt the stratagem at all. A hawk which is fast enough
and clever enough to make a ringing quarry put in is generally
able, in a good country, to take him when he has done so;
and, except in a good country, ringing flights should not be
attempted. When the moult is over, if any merlins continue
to persevere at larks it is possible that the device might be
adopted with advantage. The bagged lark would then be
given, not with any idea that it will be seriously mistaken for
the real quarry, but as a <i>bonne bouche</i> simply, to show the hawk
that her prolonged exertions in bringing the quarry down have
not been unprofitable to her. At this period the very best
hawks, even when flown in casts, will put in ringing quarry in
places where they cannot be found, and, if repeatedly so disappointed,
will give up that sort of flight; whereas if, when they
have beaten the lark in the air, and thus played their fair share in
the game, the man can occasionally make a show of playing his
part by producing a live quarry in the spot where the real
quarry ought to be found, the hawks may accept the situation,
though without being really deceived, and persevere. Unfortunately,
in these cases how seldom it is that anyone can arrive
at the spot in time to thus gratify the hawks! They will, after
their intended victim has put in, take their stand close to the
place, peeping and prying about, and perhaps trying to &ldquo;walk
it up&rdquo;; and may there remain for a few minutes. Five minutes
is as much as you can at all reasonably expect. How is the
man, half a mile behind where the hawks came down, to find
and get to them in five minutes? If he catches sight of them
at all, it will often be by mere good luck. More often than not
his first intimation as to where the flight ended is to be gained
by noticing from which direction the hawk came to her lure. For
as soon as the hawk engaged in a flight goes out of sight, either
in the sky or over a ridge, or by reason merely of the distance
to which she has gone, the lure should be produced, and kept
in evidence as long as the search is continued.</p>

<p>In finding a hawk after a long flight it is useful to bear in
mind a few hints which experience has taught. Of course in
the case of the bigger hawks the bell is an invaluable guide.
The hawker&rsquo;s ear should be always ready to catch the faintest
sound of this well-known tell-tale. But merlins seldom or
never wear bells in the field. It will be well, therefore, to give
some brief directions as to finding these little hawks. These
will be useful also in searching for others when not found by
the bell. The person who was nearest to the hawk when she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">« 202 »</a></span>
went out of sight will get on as fast as he can to the place over
which he last saw her in the air, and may with advantage give
notice to others following behind by holding up a hand or
making any other signal that has been agreed upon. He will
then, if there is a marker within hail, shout or signal a demand
for information. If none is forthcoming, he will note with his
eye the coverts or places of refuge on ahead of him, and consider
which of them was most probably the destination of the
quarry. The most likely is certainly the one which lies in a
straight line with the course which the two birds were taking;
and the next most likely is the nearest in an oblique direction on
the down-wind side. If the place which seems most likely should
be a plantation, copse, or spinny, let him then, by tracing an
imaginary straight line over the intervening ground, decide
which is the nearest part of this covert&mdash;irrespective of wind&mdash;to
the spot whereon he stands. In this spot, and no other, the
quarry will probably have put in. So constant is this choice by
a lark of the very nearest bush in any thicket, that, after searching
it thoroughly without success, I should be inclined to leave
that plantation altogether and try some other place of shelter.
If the hawk has killed, she will be either in the covert or somewhere
not far off, where she may have taken her victim to
devour him in the open, free from the danger of unwelcome
intruders, who in any thick place might come up unawares.
Such a spot will generally be tolerably conspicuous. A mound
of earth, a heap of stones, a ridge of raised turf or ant-hill is
often chosen. When the ground is wet, merlins and hobbies
will sometimes carry their quarry a long way merely in the
hope of finding a dry place whereon to deplume and devour it.
I have known a merlin carry nearly half a mile on a very hot
day in order to get under the shade of a distant tree.</p>

<p>Many minutes will elapse between the time when the quarry
has been taken and the moment when the hawk has completely
finished her repast. Accordingly, the search may be prolonged
for at least half an hour before the chance of success is given
up and the hawk pronounced &ldquo;lost&rdquo; for the time being. Some
hawks when in high condition will not break in to their quarry
or even plume it before their master or some other person
comes up, but, after killing it, stand expectant, looking round
about them, and apparently in a sort of brown study, forgetful
that such a thing as hunger exists. Some are even so little
eager to begin upon the excellent meal which is before them,
that they will jump from it to the fist as soon as it is within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">« 203 »</a></span>
reach. I have known a merlin fly her best at a mounting lark,
take it after a hard flight, and descend with it to a heap of
stones. Lighting a cigar, and sitting down beside a neighbouring
rick to wait for her to break in, I have seen her presently
go off unconcernedly to another resting-place with nothing in
her feet, and, walking up to the heap of stones, have found the
lark lying there, dead and unplucked. The hawk must have
been flying almost uniquely out of love for the sport, and not
with a view to satisfying any hunger which she felt at the time;
nor is this the only time that I have known such a thing occur.</p>

<p>As a rule, however, trained hawks in high fettle are very far
from preferring a journey to the fist or the lure to devoting their
attention to wild quarry. Much more often the difficulty is to
persuade them that for the moment they must return to their
place on the hand in order that they may be provided with
what they are hankering after&mdash;another flight. Almost all
hawks which are in the habit of constantly killing and being
fed up upon wild birds develop a passion for sport, and will
not easily, when once they have been thrown off, abandon the
idea that they are to kill something before they come back.
It is for this reason that I have advocated the frequent practice
of flying merlins to the lure and sparrow-hawks to the fist, not
only when the hawk is not to be used in the field, but when she
is. Few things are more vexatious than the delay which occurs
when a hawk, however good in other respects, is bad at the
lure, and keeps the whole field waiting until it is her good
pleasure to come down. Such performers as Queen and Sis,
and the famous rook-hawk Bois-le-Duc, which fly for a week or
more, killing daily without any miss, are in danger of quite forgetting
what a lure is like, unless they are exercised to it for
mere practice from time to time. Here, again, the question of
dieting will be found to be of much importance. A hawk may
be ready enough to fly wild quarry long before she is ready to
come to the lure. An extra hour of fasting on the one hand, or
an extra ounce of food on the other, may make all the difference
in the alacrity of the hawk when required to come down.</p>

<p>In spite of all the falconer&rsquo;s care, there will be times when
a hawk stands obstinately at perch, refusing contemptuously
to come, or perhaps even to look, at the dead lure. On such
occasions, if time is valuable, it may sometimes be expedient
to resort to the live lure. This, however, should always be
regarded as a last resource. If reserved for special occasions
it will never fail to bring down the most disobedient offender,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">« 204 »</a></span>
but if live lures are commonly used they lose part of their
efficacy, and are apt to become almost as much despised as
the ordinary dead ones. Of course when live lures are used
pains will be taken to make the process as little disagreeable
as possible to the creature whose life is risked. When a pigeon
is employed, as it almost always is for any of the big hawks, a
pair of soft and broad jesses should be attached to its legs, and
the ends of those to a strong but fine cord or creance, or a
noose of soft cord may be passed round each leg by means of
the double-ring knot shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_26">26</a>, <a href="#fig_27">27</a>.</p>

<p>When the pigeon (or lark or other bird) is thrown up it
should be allowed to fly a short distance, then gently stopped
by the creance and allowed to alight on the ground. As the
hawk comes at it, it can be jerked away with a steady pull,
and, as the hawk throws up, it can be secured and hidden,
while a dead pigeon of the same colour is thrown down in its
place. No great amount of dexterity is required to execute
this little man&oelig;]uvre. The hawk will be taken up on the dead
bird, and the live one liberated or returned to its dovecot
none the worse for its perilous adventure. It is only when the
falconer bungles his part of the business that the live lure is
struck and either killed or hurt.</p>

<p>For sparrow-hawks or merlins, when they decline to come
down, and stand waiting for the chance of another flight,
another device may sometimes be employed with a view to
saving time. There has been an unsuccessful flight, and the
little hawk goes to perch upon a rick, neglectful of the proffered
fist or lure. She came out, as she has made up her mind, to
taste blood, and blood she means to have, if she has to wait for
it till sundown. As you cannot afford to wait her good pleasure
till then, you may settle the matter by a sort of compromise.
Leave her to herself upon the rick, and walk the surrounding
country until you put up the quarry of which she is so much in
want. By driving the fields or hedges constantly towards her
you may beat a considerable extent of ground. If you draw it
blank go on a little farther. As the hawk sees you beginning
to beat that farther country, ten to one she will come on after
you and take up her position on a fresh resting-place nearer
the scene of your operations. You may go on thus sometimes
for quite a long walk, the hawk not, indeed, standing on your
fist in orthodox style, but keeping in a place where she can
start at anything you put up with a fair chance of overtaking it.
As soon as anything so put up has been taken, you pick up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">« 205 »</a></span>
your rebellious hawk in the same way as if she had flown from
the fist, and, if you are wise, you do not give her a big crop. In
the case of merlins there is another plan: you may fly another
hawk while the first is sulking or fooling away her time on her
self-selected perch. The latter will indubitably join in when
you throw off the hawk on your fist, and you will have a double
flight, after which, if it ends in a kill, you will be able to take
up both hawks easily enough.</p>

<p>In theory, after every unsuccessful flight the hawk ought to
observe certain fixed rules of conduct. Peregrines and almost
all other long-winged hawks ought first to throw up over the
place where the quarry has put in, and then wait on a while
for the falconer to come up. Short-winged hawks, and often
lanners, should take perch as near as they conveniently can to
the quarry&rsquo;s place of refuge; and merlins will get still nearer,
very often waiting on the ground within a few feet of the
hidden lark. From these various situations they ought, if in
proper order, to be ready to come whenever the falconer
wishes&mdash;to the fist if they are short-winged, to the lure if long-winged.
It is also, alas! possible that they may have failed
through being outflown&mdash;beaten fairly in the air. Directly the
falconer sees, by the spreading of the hawk&rsquo;s wings, that this
sad event has occurred, he will begin to swing his lure, and in
such case my lady ought&mdash;and generally will&mdash;at once rally to
headquarters. The young falconer should endeavour from the
first to keep his charges in such condition that they will always
come to the lure. If, at the same time, they are keen enough
to do this and high-fed enough to do themselves justice in a
hard flight, they may be called really well trained. Here lies
the real difficulty of hawking&mdash;to strike the balance justly
between too servile obedience and too disdainful independence.
Every day, and with every hawk, whether eyess or passager,
the falconer is confronted with it, only in the case of passagers
it is naturally more obvious. Wild-caught hawks are only
brought by degrees, and with a good deal of trouble, to really
like the dead lure, whereas to most eyesses their first notion of
working for their living is connected with the slight trouble of
flying either to the lure or to the hack board. Yet of the two
it is much more essentially necessary that the passage hawk
should come down quickly after failing in a flight, for if she
does not, she will hang about for a more or less limited time
near the spot where she lost her intended prey. And every
additional minute that she stays out alone, especially if out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">« 206 »</a></span>
her master&rsquo;s sight, she is being reminded more and more of
her old life at large. Then, if even she does not go soaring or
prowling about in the deliberate search for quarry, she may
espy some passing wood-pigeon or other too tempting bird, and
be off in pursuit before any of the hawking party are near
enough to keep her in sight. And a passage hawk which has
flown and fed herself on her own account is, of course, much
less likely to be recovered than an eyess, to which real liberty
is a blessing hitherto unknown. With the latter the balance of
danger lies often on the side of making them too fond of the
lure.</p>

<p>The falconer should have with him in the field a pencil and
small notebook, or at the least a card, upon which he can jot
down a brief note or record of each flight, so that on his return
home he can enter in his quarry-book a summary of the day&rsquo;s
sport. The performances of each hawk should also be recorded
in this book, as it is only by reference to this authentic volume,
correctly kept day after day, that it can be known and remembered
how she has acquitted herself. On the chance that it
may be useful as a specimen, I give here an extract from the
quarry-book which I keep, and which has been found to record
pretty fully and in an exceedingly small space the chief points
of interest in every day&rsquo;s proceedings. The first column gives
the month and the name of each hawk, the second and following
columns give the numbers of the days of the month and the
scores made by each hawk. The units mean that a flight was
successful, the zeros that it was not. When a fraction, such as &#189;,
occurs it signifies that the hawk flew double, in company with
another, and that the flight ended in a kill. The sign &#65285; stands
for a double flight in which the quarry escaped. <span class="smcap">L</span> means that
a hawk was lost or left out, and <span class="smcap">C</span> that she was recovered. At
the foot may be a short note as to the day&rsquo;s weather.</p>

<p>Or the double flights may be recorded separately, which
is perhaps a better plan. In the general score I mark &#189;
to each hawk which has done any work in a double flight,
although in the individual score for the day the fraction
set opposite her name may be a larger or smaller one,
according as she has done a larger or smaller proportion of
the work.</p>

<p>In the same book which contains such tables it is well to
write down some account of any flights which seem to deserve
particular notice, as well as notes as to the behaviour of the
hawks, their state of health and condition, and any physic
which has been administered to them. In fact the book may
be made not only a bald record of mere results, but a running
commentary upon your sport as it proceeds, to which you may
refer not only for pleasant memories in the past, but for hints
and warnings for the future.</p>

<p>In lark-hawking the character of the flights is so different,
as has already been explained, that a record of them is hardly
complete unless it contains some further indications than appear
in the above tables. I add, therefore, a specimen of a score
kept in rather fuller form, which, although it may seem rather
elaborate in print, is simple and easy enough to keep when in
manuscript. Here the lines reserved for each hawk must be
somewhat larger than in the other table, so that each unit
standing on a line with the hawk&rsquo;s name may have a letter or
indication of some kind placed immediately above or below it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">« 208 »</a></span>

<p>Here, taking the first hawk&rsquo;s score, it appears that on the
afternoon of September 1 she took one ground lark (<span class="smcap">G</span>) (see
<a href="#CHAPTER_IX">Chapter <span class="smcap">IX</span>.</a>). Secondly, that she flew a ringing lark (<span class="smcap">R</span>), which
she beat in the air, forcing it to put in (p), and that it could
not be found or got up again, and therefore does not count as a
kill, but as a miss. Thirdly, that she flew and killed another
ringer, and that after these two hard flights she was not flown
again, but fed up. The next day, the wind being strong, she
began with a double flight at a mounting lark, in which Ruby
was her companion, and they bested the quarry, which put in,
but could not be found; then flew a mounting lark (<span class="smcap">M</span>), and
took it in the air (a); and then a ground lark, which put in, but
was routed up and taken. Finally, having killed a ringer, she
was fed up and excused further flying. On September 3 the
weather conditions were better, and in the afternoon Pearl flew a
mounting lark, which put in, and was taken up by the hand (h).
Had it been a good ringer probably it would have been kicked up
instead, on the chance of a good flight; and if killed, the hawk
might have been fed up. As, however, it was only a &ldquo;mounter,&rdquo;
it was thought best to keep the hawk for the chance of a
ringer later on. The second lark, however, was also a mounter,
and the hawk, having taken it in the air, was flown again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">« 209 »</a></span>
Then came a ringer, which was well flown, and bested in the
air, but escaped by putting in. At length there was a successful
flight at a ringer, which, however, was not killed until it had
been routed out from the shelter to which it had put in, and
afforded a second flight. The double <span class="smcap">RR</span> over the record of
this item in the score shows that at the second start as well
as the first the flight was a ringing one.</p>

<p>Ruby&rsquo;s score begins on the morning of September 1 with a
double flight at a mounting lark, in which he did most of the
work, and took the quarry in the air. He is therefore credited
with &#190; of the lark, to mark his superiority, whereas only &#188; is
scored to Diamond, who was his companion in the flight. In
the afternoon he puts in a mounter, which is lost, kills a ground
lark, and then puts in another mounter, which is routed out,
but puts in again, and is only taken when driven out a second
time from his hiding-place. Having stuck to this lark well, and
accurately marked the places where he put in, the little jack is
excused from further flying. Next day he begins with the unsuccessful
flight which he flew with Pearl. Then he takes a
mounter in the air, and at the next attempt goes up so far after
a first-rate ringer that no one can keep him in sight. As this
lark was obviously making for a big plantation towards which
the flight went, and as the hawk, though usually obedient to
the lure, did not come to it or appear again, it is almost certain
that he must have killed. The fairest way in such cases is to
mark the flight by a (?), and not count it either as a kill or a
miss in the general score. The <span class="smcap">L</span> shows that Ruby was left
out, and the (1) on the following morning shows that it was
ascertained in some way that while roaming about on his own
account he killed (and ate) a lark. The <span class="smcap">C</span> indicates his recovery
late in the day; and the manner of his recapture, of course, is
referred to in the notes.</p>

<p>Diamond&rsquo;s first item is the &#188; credited to him for the part he
played in the double flight with Ruby. He goes on by killing
a ringer in the morning; and for his pains is rewarded with a
good half of it, being then reserved for the last of the afternoon&rsquo;s
flights, when the half-lark may have ceased to trouble his digestive
organs. In the evening he puts in first a mounter and then
a ringer, and then having with some difficulty and after a long
flight killed a good mounter, is fed up just before it gets dark.
On the morrow he falls in with two ground larks in succession,
and kills them both. Hitherto, ever since the double flight with
Ruby, in which he was outpaced, he has been doing well.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">« 210 »</a></span>
Though not a fast hawk he has persevered and bested all his
larks in the air, though he has put them in so far off that it was
difficult to find them. But now he is to disgrace himself by
showing the white feather. He starts at a good ringer, but,
finding it too fast for him, comes back humbly to the lure.
The little (a), which is a mark of honour when seen under a
kill, is a terrible blemish to a score when found under a &ldquo;duck&rsquo;s
egg&rdquo;&mdash;showing that not the quarry but the hawk has been
beaten in the air. After this sad exhibition Diamond is fed
up, and examined to see whether by some mistake he has
perchance been allowed to get thin. If he has, there is an
excuse for his poltroonery. Anyhow he will be well fed now,
and if he does not fly better to-morrow physicking may be
advisable. A medical council must be held over his case. On
the next day, however, he re-establishes his character. Lighting
at the first trial upon a ringer, he sticks to it like a man,
puts it in, and then takes it cleverly enough. Of course after
this success, following upon the fiasco of yesterday, he is at
once fed up. Peeping a little behind the scenes we may, it is
true, suspect that the ringer, though quite properly marked so
in the score-sheet, would not have figured as such if Pearl had
had to deal with him instead of Diamond. He would have
tried to take the air, certainly, and mounted as if intending to
go up in circles. But Pearl would have been up to him before
he completed the first ring, and from that moment, keeping the
upper hand of him, she would have given him trouble enough to
shift from her stoops without nursing any such ambition as to
fly right away from her.</p>

<p>A score-sheet thus kept gives at a glance an excellent idea
of the performances of the hawks referred to. As their several
scores are usually kept on the same page in successive lines, a
comparison between them can be readily made at any time;
and if a period of two or three weeks is taken, the best average
made in the time will usually belong to the best hawk. If only
a week or less is brought into the account, it may easily be
that a very good hawk by a run of bad luck scores fewer kills
and makes a lower average than a more moderate performer.
The true test of merit is the ringing flights; and if these alone
are considered, the result of an analysis will infallibly settle the
question which is the better hawk. Thus in the score last
above given, there is no difficulty in perceiving that Pearl, who
killed three ringers out of five, and put in the other two, was a
much better hawk during the short period under notice than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">« 211 »</a></span>
Diamond, who killed two out of four and failed once to put his
ringer in. The mere number of quarry killed in a season is not
a conclusive test of merit; for it is more creditable to a hawk
to kill one ringer than half a dozen ground larks. The greatest
number of larks I have killed in one season with any hawk in
single flights is 106. But Jubilee, who accomplished this feat,
was certainly not so good as his sister, Queen, who killed 95 in
the same time. Nor was the latter&mdash;I think&mdash;as good as Eva,
who killed only about 65.</p>

<p>The same method of scoring might be, with some adaptation,
used for rook-hawks, and possibly for game-hawks. The
short-winged varieties are usually flown at such a number of
different quarry that another system would have to be employed.
But in all cases the quarry-book should be a sort of diary in
which may be traced the history of each hawk as she improved
from time to time or fell off in merit. The less experience the
falconer has the fuller he should make his notes. Both in
making them and in referring to them questions will arise about
which he is in doubt; and practice alone, or timely hints from
a master in the art, will solve the difficulties. Any falconer
who has kept diaries for any long period will find that at
the end of it he has altered several of the methods which he
practised at the beginning. It requires some time and trouble,
no doubt, to write up the notes every day. But, as it has been
before observed, no one can expect without a good deal of toil
to become a successful falconer.</p>

<p>It will be seen by a look at the score-sheet, as well as by
perusing any falconer&rsquo;s notes, that first-rate results are arrived
at partly by the excellence of the hawks flown and partly by
the activity and diligence of the falconer and his assistants. It
is no use for a falcon to bring down her ringing rook from the
clouds, or a merlin her lark from out of sight in the sky, if when
the quarry has put in there is no man forthcoming to drive it out
again. The sparrow-hawk will make but a poor show unless she
is backed up energetically by an excited field of beaters; and
tiercels will soon give up flying magpies with any zest if they
find that their friends down below are slack or incompetent in
playing their part of the game. You think yourself entitled to
grumble at your hawk, and perhaps call her ugly names, if just
at the moment you call upon her she does not fly her best. Do
you not think that she also is aggrieved if you at the same time,
chosen as it is by you, do not give her the necessary amount of
help? Incapacity or laziness on the part of a man or a dog
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">« 212 »</a></span>
provokes the contempt and disgust of a trained hawk, who is
often a much better critic in such matters than the ignorant
may suppose. Be careful, therefore, if you want to retain the
respect of your hawk, not to give her just cause to complain of
you; not to be slow when you should be quick, or hasty when
caution or deliberation is needed; not to seem inattentive to
her fair and just requirements. And above all, not to commit
in her presence anything which she knows is a gross mistake&mdash;in
short, not to make a fool either of yourself or her.</p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Lost Hawks</span></p>


<p>After a day of unsuccessful flights the falconer returning
sadly with his discouraged hawks may derive some consolation
from the thought that he has at least brought them all
safe back. On the other hand, the triumphs of the most successful
afternoon are a good deal marred when one of the best
performers has been left out, and the quarry-book has to be
noted up, opposite her name, with the unpleasant word &ldquo;lost.&rdquo;
Foremost amongst the dangers and difficulties which beset the
falconer, more plentifully than any other sportsman, is the risk
which constantly hangs over him of losing the faithful ally upon
whose service he depends for carrying on his sport. Every time
that he puts a hawk upon the wing he has to face this contingency,
which is more or less probable according to the nature
of the flight which is attempted. No questions are more often
addressed by the uninitiated to a falconer than these: &ldquo;How do
you get your hawks back?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do they always come to
you?&rdquo; If he is rash enough to answer the last query in the
affirmative he may be utterly confounded by having to confess
that the very next time he flew his hawk she did not come
back! Of course, in exercising an obedient hawk when she is
sharp-set the risk run is infinitesimally small. But it would be
wrong even then to say that it does not exist. And unfortunately
the harder the flight undertaken, and the better the
hawk, the greater is the danger which her owner has to face.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to enumerate the many causes which may
lead to the loss of a hawk. They have been mentioned incidentally
in many of the foregoing pages. But it is well to
remember that a very large percentage of the losses which
annually occur is due to mere carelessness on the part of the
falconer. As long as you make no mistake, and give your
hawks a fair chance, the danger of an out-and-out loss is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">« 214 »</a></span>
reduced to very moderate dimensions. The worst cases, as well
as the commonest, are those in which the man is blamable for
some imprudence, and not the hawk for any vice or fault. A
much greater number of hawks annually get loose with the
leash still attached to their jesses than anyone would be likely
to suppose. Whenever such a mishap occurs a search should
instantly be made for the fugitive, for every minute which
elapses between the time of her loss and her recovery makes it
more probable that she will not again be seen alive. The long
tail of the leash becomes a sort of death-trap affixed to the
hawk herself. As often as she takes perch in a tree, or flies
over a telegraph-wire, or near to anything around which the
hanging strap can coil itself, there is the chance of its getting
entangled, in which case the hawk, hanging head downwards
will, after many struggles, perish ignominiously, perhaps before
the eyes of her helpless owner.</p>

<p>Even if the leash is not attached when the hawk gets away,
or luckily drops out of the swivel, there is no little danger that
the jesses, joined together at their ends by the swivel, will get
hitched up, and a similar disaster result. All accidents which
occur in this way are due to sheer carelessness. No hawk
should ever be put upon the wing at all unless her swivel has
first been detached. Even the jesses, if they have big slits in
their ends, should be straightened out when they have been
freed from the swivel, so that there is no chance of their getting
hooked up on a nail or strong thorn.</p>

<p>On the first intelligence that a trained hawk has got loose,
the falconer should start in pursuit, provided with a dead lure
in any case, and, if the hawk was not sharp-set at the time, with
a live lure also. The more searchers that can be sent out, the
better; and these should make inquiries of every person they
meet. Any of them who are not competent to take up a hawk
themselves may carry a whistle, or pistol, or any signal agreed
upon, by which they may call up the falconer if they get tidings
or a view of the truant. In the latter case they must take care
not to alarm the hawk or give her any inducement to move
about, for each time she moves she runs a fresh risk of getting
entangled and brought to grief. The search for a hawk which
has a leash or swivel attached is not altogether the same as
the search for one that has only her bells and jesses. For the
fear is now not that the runaway, having tasted the sweets of
liberty, will little by little acquire or resume the habits of a wild
hawk, but that, being still as ready as ever to come to the lure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">« 215 »</a></span>
or the fist, she will involuntarily commit suicide by hanging
herself head downwards before you have time to find her and
interfere. Thus the searchers will go about their work with all
the speed consistent with thoroughness, visiting first the places
where there is most danger of a fatal disaster, such as wire
fencing, telegraph lines, and such bushy or thorny trees as
the lost hawk has ever been known to frequent. In an open
country loose hawks with their leashes on will sometimes escape
with their lives for days together, and even kill quarry, and
keep themselves in high condition. These, however, are the
exceptions; and in a wooded country such a fortunate issue to
the adventure would be unlikely.</p>

<p>When the loss of a hawk has occurred in consequence of her
having killed out of sight, and gorged herself before she could
be discovered, the chances are that she will remain for the night
in the neighbourhood of the place where she flew the quarry
upon which she dined. A visit will be paid, therefore, next
morning at daybreak to this part of the country; and the
falconer must not assume that if he fails to find quickly the
object of his search she is to be looked for somewhere else. For
it is unlikely, wherever she is, that she will pay any attention
to him or his lure until she has cast. This she may not do,
especially if it was late in the previous day when she was lost,
until some hours after a spring or summer sunrise. Consequently,
even if the searcher gets away from this most likely spot,
and explores the plantations for considerable distances round
about, he should return to it from time to time, on the chance
that she has been there all the while, waiting till her appetite
came before making her presence known. As the day grows
older, the radius within which the search is continued may
be indefinitely enlarged. Every labourer going to his work,
every farmer going his rounds, every shepherd walking towards
his fold, should be interrogated when met, and asked, if they see
anything of the lost hawk, to report it in some way. The neighbouring
keepers may be warned, although probably they will
long before this have been informed that trained hawks are in
the neighbourhood. A man will hardly fly his hawks in a part
of the world where he does not know that the keepers are to
be relied upon.</p>

<p>When the hawk has been lost through raking away or checking
at chance quarry, the work of finding her necessitates often
very great exertions and fatigue. There is nothing particularly
unusual in the fact of a passage peregrine wandering off in an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">« 216 »</a></span>
afternoon seven or eight miles from the place where she was
lost sight of. To explore at all thoroughly an area eight miles
long and ten broad at the far end means, of course, a great many
miles travelling, even if the country is exceptionally open and
clear of trees. Nevertheless, the dull and dreary journey must
be undertaken if there is a real desire to recover the wanderer.
The best hawk-finder is he who travels the farthest and sees the
greatest number of possible assistants in his search. If you
make an excuse for shirking a visit to a particular copse or
valley, it is as likely as not that you will hear afterwards, to
your chagrin, that the missing hawk was seen there, and might
easily have been caught. If you will not walk a quarter of a
mile out of the way to hail a passer-by who is going in what
you think an unlikely direction, that will perhaps be the very
man who, ten minutes afterwards, comes across the object of
your pursuit.</p>

<p>There is not much to guide a man in choosing what direction
he should prefer for going about his search. But, other
influences being equal, the truant is more likely to have gone
down-wind than up. Weak hawks especially, when they have no
particular object in facing the wind, are apt to shirk the trouble
of flying against it, and drift away to leeward. Of course, if it
is an eyess that has gone astray, and the place where she was
hacked is within easy reach, there is a more or less strong probability
that she may have gone towards it. Eyess hobbies, when
lost, are said almost invariably to go back to the hack place
in this way. Merlins have been known to do so, though not
within my own experience. But a really strong and fast hawk,
in full flying order, seems often to assume almost at once the
rôle of a wild one. Such a hawk, especially if fond of soaring,
soon sees that there will be little difficulty in finding her own
living. And she sets about it without any particular influence
to guide her, starting in whatever direction chance may decide,
and shifting her ground as capriciously as it is possible to imagine.
When Tagrag, already mentioned, was out, he would be
reported one night in a certain plantation, and early the next
morning would be seen three or four miles off on the opposite
side of the small village where he ought to have been housed,
and where his brothers were (or ought to have been) lamenting
his absence from the screen-perch.</p>

<p>Farm-houses and all habitations near the spot where a hawk
was lost should be visited without delay. Not only are they
generally frequented by either pigeons or fowls, towards which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">« 217 »</a></span>
a stray peregrine or goshawk may well cast a hungry glance,
but their shelter is always a tempting haven for any wandering
house-pigeon which may have been chased and bested in the
air. As the falconer proceeds from place to place, swinging his
lure and calling or whistling, if it is his custom to use such
means of bringing up his hawk, he should note the behaviour
of the rooks and other birds within sight The presence of any
hawk, especially if carrying a bell, causes some excitement
amongst the feathered world. The unwarlike wanderers of the
air, when an armed cruiser comes in sight, exhibit some such
signs of panic as might be expected of a fleet of merchantmen
if a hostile battleship were viewed in the offing. The symptoms
most remarkable are generally those observed in a flight of rooks,
which often begins to whirl about in the air, as if it were composed
of escaped lunatics, shooting up and wheeling suddenly
in unexpected directions, filling the air at the same time with
discordant croaks and screams, and with big black specks, which
hurl themselves about as if driven by impulses which they themselves
cannot understand or control. But many other birds, by
their strange movements and queer attitudes, will betray the
near presence of a hawk to whose visits they are unaccustomed.
When a hawk has killed anything, and is pluming or eating it,
crows, magpies, and jays have a way of sitting on the top of a
neighbouring tree, craning their necks, and peering down with
a morbid curiosity as they watch an operation of which they
strongly disapprove.</p>

<p>Rooks, starlings, and small birds are all fond of mobbing a
strange hawk when they think they can do it with impunity,
and swallows occasionally indulge in the same rather adventurous
amusement. It is therefore often worth while to make a <i>détour</i>
and investigate, whenever any bird seems to be engaged in
eccentric and unusual movements. Of the thousand and one
causes which may have given rise to such vagaries, only the
most practised eye can determine which are likely to be connected
with the appearance of the lost hawk, and which are not.
The safest plan is to go up and make sure that the commotion
is not to be explained in this way. Of course when a hawk
has been in the habit of flying any particular quarry, a disturbance
amongst birds of that species is more likely to arise from
her presence than in other cases. But most peregrines, when
they are at large, are fond of taking occasional shots at lapwings,
though very seldom with success. Merlins, though they are
most partial to skylarks, will make stoops at any bird which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">« 218 »</a></span>
they suppose they can tackle, from a wood-pigeon to a wren;
and the short-winged hawks are, of course, almost always ready
for any bloodthirsty adventure.</p>

<p>Fortunately stray hawks, at least of the long-winged kinds,
do not usually betake themselves to thick places where they
cannot easily be seen. In open countries, where alone they
should be flown, there is no great choice for them of convenient
perching-places. Probably the most likely of all stations for
them to take up are the tops of ricks; and here a peregrine,
or even a merlin, can be distinguished at a great distance by a
pair of good field-glasses. As a rule, the best hawks like the
highest perches, where they can command, as from a watch-tower,
the farthest view of the country over which they hope for
a chance flight. A hawk which takes perch on low railings or
on the ground is not usually much of a performer. Some of
these are very fond of perching on fallow-fields, where it is almost
impossible for an unpractised eye to distinguish their plumage
against the colour of the ground. A knowledge of their ways
will make the falconer aware that in such a field, however
apparently flat, there will be either mounds or small peaks and
projections of earth where clods have been unevenly turned up,
which a hawk is sure to choose as a resting-place in preference
to the surrounding ground for some distance on every side.
The predilections of each of his hawks for particular kinds of
perching-places will generally have been noted to some extent
by the falconer, who will naturally look for each of them on the
sort of stand which he knows that she most often prefers. Trees,
while still leafy, are some of the worst places in which to have
to search, and of course they are very common resorts. A lost
hawk may be watching her pursuers as unseen as King Charles
in the oak, and not deigning to come down to the most enticing
dead lure, until, having cast, she feels an inclination to do so.</p>

<p>When a lost hawk is not recovered early in the morning a
very good plan is to fly another, either at the lure or at some
quarry, in the neighbourhood of the place where the loss occurred,
or where you have ascertained that the truant was last seen.
And the higher the decoy hawk can be induced to go the more
chance will there naturally be that the other may come up and
join her. Whenever one hawk is on the wing for any length of
time, there is a good chance that every other hawk within about
a mile will catch sight of her, and not a bad chance that the
other may come up. In case of a high ringing flight, wild hawks
will come up from much farther than a mile. And lost hawks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">« 219 »</a></span>
will, of course, come and fraternise much more readily, especially
if the stable-companion flown as a decoy happens to have been
a comrade at hack or in some double flights. They will, however,
do so quickly enough without any special inducement at
all. A friend of mine brought a hawk, newly trained, from a
distance to Salisbury Plain. She was lost in a very long flight
before she had passed a single night in the house to which she
was being taken, and was not even seen by her owner for two
or three whole days. One morning I was exercising a hawk
which the lost one had never seen, and suddenly there were
two hawks stooping to the lure instead of one. I had never
seen the wanderer, but understood at once what had occurred,
and tried to so arrange that the lure should be struck by the
new-comer. Either by accident or design she failed two or three
times in succession to do this, and I was obliged to take down
my own hawk and carry her in, and bring out a live lure for
the other, upon which she was quickly taken up. Both Tagrag,
which had been out a week, and a merlin, which had been
out for nine days, were brought up from the unknown hack
ground to join in a ringing flight by another hawk, and recaptured
in the same way.</p>

<p>A trained hawk will sometimes be taken off by wild ones,
with which she will go soaring and otherwise amusing herself
for a while. But the good-fellowship between them does not
usually last long. In the open places where long-winged hawks
are flown there are often a good many wild hawks about&mdash;peregrines,
merlins, and occasionally even hobbies, besides the
ubiquitous kestrel, with which the higher quality hawks disdain
to associate. But each wild hawk, or at least each
pair or family of wild hawks, seems to have its own appointed
beat, and resents the intrusion into it of a stranger.
Everyone knows that birds will frequently attack any interloper
which comes with any intention of staying and quartering
itself in the country already appropriated by its own denizens.
Now the wild hawks, though they will often attack a trained
one as soon as they have set eyes upon her, yet will also often
go playing with her as long as their idea is that she is merely a
visitor, and will not permanently poach on their preserves. It
is when they find that the new-comer is really intending to
take up her abode in the neighbourhood, and appropriate her
share of the booty, which they looked upon as reserved for
themselves, that they begin to really make it so hot for her that
she is fain to get on into a less-favoured district which has not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">« 220 »</a></span>
been already effectively occupied. Thus the copse haunted by
a couple of young peregrines, or the down quartered by a wild
merlin every day, is not the best place to look for a trained
bird of the same species which has been lost for more than
twenty-four hours, although during the first period the tame and
the wild bird may be seen stooping at one another or racing
together in a most amicable style. If you have seen them
together one day, and been unable to get down your own hawk,
you will do well to seek her afterwards not on the same ground,
but in a different, though not very distant, district.</p>

<p>As soon as you can get well within sight of your lost hawk,
the live lure may be relied upon to effect her capture, until she
has been out several days&mdash;in the case of eyesses for at least a
week. But I should not advise forcing it upon her notice at a
time when she has a full crop, if you can defer this at all safely
until she has had time to get a bit hungry again. For though
she will probably take and kill the bird offered, she may, if
she is not hungry, refuse to stay on it while you can secure
her; whereas when she is keen after her meal you will be
able to wind her up as she stands over it on any reasonably
level piece of ground. The process of winding up consists in
merely dragging a fine line, the end of which is affixed to the
quarry or to a stone or weight, round and round the feet of
a hawk which is feeding on the ground. The difficulty is to
pass the line under the tail, which, of course, acts as a mild sort
of shield to keep the cord off. As the falconer walks round and
round his hawk with the end of the line in his hand he must
wait, as the line gets to the hawk&rsquo;s tail, for a favourable opportunity
of pulling it under. If the hawk is fidgety and keeps
disengaging her feet from the loops which have been already
wound round her, it may be necessary to make many circles,
and to begin the work several times all over again. But if the
hawk is not frightened by any violent pulls on the line, or by unsuccessful
attempts to take her up, the loops will sooner or later
be so securely hitched round one or both feet that she cannot
possibly escape. In the case of a hawk which has been out
long, and is shy and suspicious, a long line must be used, and
much care must be taken not to alarm her by jerking or tugging
at it as you wind. Some hawks will, during a week&rsquo;s holiday,
have retained a great many of the habits and much of the tameness
which a course of training has deeply instilled into them,
while others will in the same space of time have developed
into almost wild creatures. This method of recapture is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">« 221 »</a></span>
usually the simplest and handiest, when it is found impossible
to take the hawk up by hand in the ordinary way. For no
preparation or paraphernalia are required except a live lure
and a long coil of string. If, however, you prefer to haul about
with you a bow net with its pegs and rings, and do not mind
the trouble and delay of setting the net, with the bait in the
proper place, that will, of course, effect your purpose in many
instances very well. But it is rather an intricate business compared
with the other, and one in which an unpractised hand
may easily make a mistake.</p>

<p>Another plan which has been recommended is to fly a
bagged pigeon or other quarry in a light creance, and let the
lost hawk take it. Then, as she is breaking in, walk slowly in
and endeavour to take her up with the hand. If she objects
and tries to carry, let her go, but keep hold of her victim, which
she will be obliged to drop. Then, pegging that victim down
firmly to the ground, take a few feathers and stick them up in
the earth on every side of the body, the tips bending inwards,
but not quite touching it. Round these feathers pass the loop of
a cord with a running slip-knot in it, and carry the end of the
cord right away to a distance, where you can hide, or where at
least your presence will not prevent the hawk from coming
back. As soon as she has come back pull the string, which will
tighten the noose round her legs, and, keeping it taut, run in
and secure your prisoner. The plan is ingenious and sounds
feasible. I cannot doubt that it has been found so. Only&mdash;what
if the hawk never comes back at all? You may sit for
hours, with the string ready in your hand, waiting for her to
reappear, and if she does not, will you not look rather small?
Often, perhaps, hawks do so reappear. But sometimes I can
affirm that they do not. A lost hawk in full condition and
feather will, if scared away from one quarry, not always sit
disconsolate watching for a chance of getting back to it, but go
off simply and kill something else. A third-rate hawk may be
so overjoyed at having for once captured some live creature,
and so diffident about getting another before nightfall, that she
will hang about and come back to her much-prized victim.
But remember that it is the best hawks which run most risk of
being lost, and which one is most anxious to get back.</p>

<p>Some hawks seem to have a natural aptitude for feeding
themselves. They will do so at hack, before their sisters and
brothers have even chased anything except in fun; and when
left out for a night they may be seen in the early morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">« 222 »</a></span>
careering about after their favourite quarry, or some other.
When tidings are brought in as to their whereabouts, the
message is either that she was &ldquo;see&rsquo;d on a bird,&rdquo; or &ldquo;very near
got &rsquo;im,&rdquo; or at least was &ldquo;chasin&rsquo; of &rsquo;em like one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; Such
hawks are easier to track, no doubt, than the dull ones which
sit still by the hour together; but on the other hand, more
activity is required to come up with them and disabuse them
of the idea that their rôle is now merely that of a wild bird.
Liberty often acts as a wonderful stimulant to a trained hawk&rsquo;s
energies. The same falcon which has persistently refused rooks,
and can seldom score off a partridge, will perhaps after twenty-four
hours&rsquo; fasting in the tree-tops bowl over with alacrity whichever
of these quarries first offers her a chance, and then, having been
reduced again into bondage, relapse into the same indifference,
and refuse to be induced by any amount either of feeding up or
starving to fly a yard after one or the other. It is extraordinary
what feats a bad hawk can be made to do by the schooling of
the hard mistress Necessity. There was once a lame merlin
which had injured her wing badly against a wire, and could only
just fly at all, and that with a clumsy wobbling action. She
was turned out loose in a place where some rebellious hobbies
were being hacked, on the chance of her bringing them down to
participate in her meals; but finding one day that her rations
were not forthcoming until much later than usual, she wandered
off in search of what she could pick up for herself, and was
caught by a lad about three miles away from where she had
started, on a small bird which she had actually killed single-handed!</p>

<p>It is a good plan, when a hawk is out, and there are more
searchers available than one, for one of them to stay at home a
good deal, so that if news of the truant is brought from any
quarter he may at once set off with his lure, and hurry straight
to the spot indicated. It is vexatious after a twenty-mile walk
to find on returning that if you had saved your trouble and sat
quietly at home you would probably have been by now in
possession of your fugitive. The labourers and other people
who are likely to catch sight of a lost hawk should be warned
not to attempt to catch it,&mdash;which is a feat that yokels have an
almost insuperable desire to undertake,&mdash;but to come at once
and bring word to the owner or his falconer. Rewards should
be offered and paid for any such information which results in
the recapture, but not otherwise, unless there is corroborative
evidence as to the facts reported; for otherwise the too generous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">« 223 »</a></span>
falconer may find that whenever one of his hawks is lost
several King Richards are reported in the field at the same
time, though not at the same place.</p>

<p>After a hawk has been recaptured, it behoves the captor
to consider what sort of preparation, if any, is required before
she is flown again. Much will depend, of course, upon the
character of the individual. A case has been very recently
mentioned in print, where a falcon lost in a flight at rooks
in the spring was only recaptured in autumn, after more than
twenty weeks&rsquo; liberty, and yet was then nearly as tame as
when his holiday began. On the other hand, I have known a
hawk in one week become so wild and shy that the manning
of him and making him to the lure took nearly as long as if he
had just been caught on the passage. A day, or even two,
naturally has little enough effect in nullifying in an eyess the
lessons which she began in early life. Two or three days'
flying at the lure, and a slight reduction in the quantity and
quality of her repasts, will generally make her obedient and
reliable enough. But with a passage hawk it is quite a different
story. Often you will have to hark back to some of the
practical arguments which you used before, when she was
being laboriously converted from a wild into a tame creature.
Washed meat may have to be put in requisition, and when the
moment does come to put her on the wing again in the field,
great endeavours should be made to give her a good start at her
quarry, so that she may again grow reconciled to her master&rsquo;s
mode of operations, and not go off to commence a fresh campaign
on her own account.</p>

<p>Very often a hawk, especially if not a very first-class
performer, comes back from an outing a good deal improved,
not only in health, but in flying powers. Occasionally, however,
I have known it to turn out otherwise. The danger is
with some hawks that while they are out they may learn to
run cunning. This abominable vice is, I think, rare in hawks,
especially in young ones. But I have known it in a jack-merlin&mdash;not
of my own training&mdash;as early as in August; and it developed
itself very badly in another jack which I lost for three
days in September, and which before he was left out had shown
no signs of it. The line adopted by the offender is to fly lazily
after the quarry, waiting for it to put in, when he marks the
place, and going straight to it jumps (if he can) upon the
fugitive. Sometimes the offence originates in double flights,
when an inferior hawk, having allowed her partner to do all or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">« 224 »</a></span>
most of the work, cuts in at the finish and secures the quarry.
But it is more rare in merlins than in jacks, which seem to me
the most prone of any hawks to this vice. A game-hawk has,
of course, little or no temptation to indulge in it, and a rook-hawk
would spoil her own game by doing so, as she cannot
follow into covert. The fault, when once developed, is difficult,
or perhaps impossible, to entirely cure. Double flights should
be entirely eschewed; and when the hawk has flown cunning
and failed she may be left where she is, unlured and unfed,
until later in the day, and then flown again and again until she
tries harder. Wild hawks (and trained ones, if long left out)
often fall into a habit of picking their flights, <i>i.e.</i> starting at a
quarry, and, if they find it a good one, turning back and waiting
for an easier chance. On the whole, therefore, if only for this
reason, I am averse to leaving out a trained hawk longer than
is absolutely unavoidable.</p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Accidents and Maladies</span></p>


<p>The care of a hawk&rsquo;s feathers is a very important and
elementary part of the falconer&rsquo;s duties. If he is naturally
clumsy or careless, and yet hopes to do any good in this
vocation, he must be continually on his guard against a mishap.
Experience and persistent watchfulness will cure him of these
defects, or at least deprive them of any very bad effects. But
an innate adroitness is certainly much to be desired in any
youth whom it is intended to train up as a falconer. The most
important of a hawk&rsquo;s feathers are exactly those which are most
easily broken. A single vigorous flap of the wing against any
hard obstacle within reach of them may very likely knock off
the end of one or two of the long flight feathers, or at least
fracture the shaft where it is quite thin, so that the end below
the injury has to be taken off and the feather mended. Great
care must therefore be taken in carrying a hawk that no
such hard substance is ever so near to her that by a sudden
movement she can strike it with either wing. Narrow doorways
should be avoided entirely, or never entered unless the
hawk is hooded and quite quiet on the fist. When walking
through a gateway or near an iron railing, stile, post, carriage,
or branch of a tree, give it a wide berth. When mounting a
horse with a hawk on the hand, get up on the wrong, <i>i.e.</i> the
off, side&mdash;unless, of course, you carry your hawk habitually on
the right hand, like the Indian falconers. Never wear a hat
with a hard brim. It is impossible for you to be sure that at
some unexpected moment a hawk, hooded or unhooded, will not
by a sudden movement just touch the edge with a wing feather.</p>

<p>The wing feathers of the short-winged hawks are more
yielding and elastic than the straighter ones of the long-winged,
and will stand a greater strain. Worst of all are merlins,
whose principal feathers are almost brittle, especially when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">« 226 »</a></span>
hawk is at all poor in condition. As for the tail feathers,
although they are of less importance to a hawk&rsquo;s flying, they
require almost more care than those of the wing. In this
particular, short-winged hawks, with their very long trains, are
more liable to injury than the others. A very common occasion
of damaging a tail feather arises while a hawk is being broken
to the hood. As the attempt is made to push the hood on and
over the head, the patient flinches and draws back the upper
part of her body, forcing the tail strongly against the wrist of
the operator, if this is in the way. Those feathers upon which
the strain bears hardest are very apt to give way; and even if
the awkward falconer has succeeded in getting the hood on, he
finds to his chagrin that he has done so at the expense of a
damaged hawk. It is of course for this reason that I have
advised the tying up of the tail whilst hooding lessons are being
given. In actual flights there are certain risks of injury to tail
feathers, although if they are all in perfect condition these risks
are less than might be supposed. The struggle which occurs
on the ground between the hawk and a robust quarry which is
bigger than herself severely tries these feathers, as the former
is obliged to make use of them to steady herself and resist the
efforts of the desperate victim to upset her or drag her along
the ground. The fight between a merlin and a partridge or
pigeon is of comparatively short duration, as the little hawk,
having her foot tightly clenched round the neck of her captive,
is sure of its death within a minute or so. But a sparrow-hawk
battling with a full-grown partridge has a tough job before her,
and is sometimes forced backwards on to her expanded tail, so
that it may give way at any weak spot, if there is one. A goshawk
which has bound to a full-grown hare, or even a big buck
rabbit, has even a hotter time of it.</p>

<p>In double flights, when both hawks have fastened on to the
same quarry, and are dragging at it in the hope of obtaining
sole possession, there is also danger to the tails. I must admit
that I know of no case in which mischief has been done, but it
is impossible to watch such a struggle, while hastening up to
interfere, without seeing that it may be fatal to some of the
feathers so roughly used. The arrival of the falconer on such
occasions, in the rôle of mediator, must be welcome to both
hawks; and he should at once catch hold of the quarry by one
wing, and, holding it tight down, proceed to the work of separating
the hawks. When the quarry is a large bird, he will offer
to the hawk which seems to have the least firm hold a substitute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">« 227 »</a></span>
for the real quarry, and get her to devote her attention
to it until the arrival of the second man, when both hawks can
be taken up. If both hawks and quarry are small, the first
falconer to come up may catch hold of the pelt and lift it up,
hawks and all, from the ground against which the tails are
being pressed and bent. Once on the fist, the danger is past;
and one or other of the combatants may be handed over, with a
tiring to replace the contested victim, to the next man who
comes up. When double flights are the order of the day, every
man who is likely to be up at the death should wear a glove
and carry a spare leash, as well as a morsel of tiring for use in a
possible emergency. He should also, if mounted, carry a weight
and tethering rein at the side of his saddle, so that he may dismount
at any time quickly and run in to the struggling hawks.</p>

<p>When a feather is bent, without any actual breakage of the
shaft, it will come straight if dipped in very hot water, but may
not improbably remain weak for some time at the place where the
bend was. Very often such a bent feather will come straight when
the hawk bathes; but it is just as well to apply the hot-water
remedy at once, and if it does not return to its proper position,
there will be little doubt that the shaft is damaged. Whenever
this is the case, the broken part should be cut neatly off and the
feather imped. When the breakage is not near the end, and consequently
in a very thin part of the shaft, the piece removed can
be put on again by imping. But if it is the tip which has gone,
as is only too often the case with beginners, the owner must make
up his mind either to keep and fly his hawk in that damaged
condition, incurring the jibes or pity of facetious or sympathetic
friends, or to undertake the rather delicate operation required
for grafting a fresh feather on the remnant of the old one.
Possibly the novice may be within reach of a professional
falconer, or an experienced amateur, who will come to his
rescue, and perform this troublesome job. If so, he should
certainly attend while it is being accomplished, and carefully
note the manner in which the professor sets about it. If not,
he must attempt it himself, and do the best he can by the aid
of his own ingenuity, and perhaps of the following directions:&mdash;</p>

<p>Hood the hawk, and have an operating-table ready, on
which you have placed a tolerably stout but soft cushion. Get
an assistant to take firm hold of the patient with both hands
round the body, over which may be previously thrown a silk
handkerchief to preserve the feathers. The assistant should
place his hands over the hawk&rsquo;s body with the palms downwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">« 228 »</a></span>
and the thumbs joined, the tips of his fingers being
towards the hawk&rsquo;s tail, and the wrists over her hood. Lowering
them quickly and gently, and bringing the outer parts of
the hands towards one another, he will get a firm grip round
the upper part of the wings and the thickest part of the body,
and will hold the hawk down firmly, but without unduly
squeezing her, upon the cushion, her feet being pressed down
underneath the body. The falconer will thus be free to operate
more boldly upon the feather to which he proposes to direct his
attention. The latter must have provided himself beforehand
with a very sharp penknife, a small saucer of vinegar or strong
brine, an imping-needle of the proper size, and a feather of the
proper sort. The imping-needle should be of iron or steel, filed
down lengthwise to a triangular shape and pointed at the ends.
It should be in the middle about two-thirds as thick as the
feather at the place of breakage. The new feather with which
the damaged hawk is to be adorned must exactly match the
one which it is to replace; that is to say, it must have occupied
the same place in the same wing, or the same side of the tail, in
a hawk of the same kind as the one now under treatment.
Before commencing operations, the imping-needle to be used
should be immersed in the bath of vinegar or salt water. With
the forefinger and thumb of the left hand, take hold of the
damaged feather just above the place of breakage, and separate
it carefully from the adjacent feathers. Then with the right
hand pass the blade of the penknife obliquely upwards along
the web of the feather on its thinner side till the edge touches
the shaft just above the place of breakage. As soon as it has
done this, turn the blade so that the flat of it, instead of being
inclined obliquely upwards with the edge pointing towards the
stouter part of the feather, is directed downwards in a plane
with the web on the broad side of the feather. Having got it
into this position, make a clean cut right through the shaft so
that the portion of it below the blade falls off. The next thing
is to measure off on the loose new feather as much of the end as
will, when fitted on to the other where it has been cut through,
add to it the exact length which it originally had. The shaft
of the new feather must then be cut through at exactly the
same angle or inclination as the other.</p>

<p>Now take an ordinary needle, and stick its point a little way
into the pith of that part of the old feather which has not been cut
off, and afterwards into the pith of the piece of new feather which
is to be grafted on, taking care that the needle goes in straight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">« 229 »</a></span>
down the middle of the pith. Into the small apertures thus
made, the imping-needle will be more easily passed in the proper
direction than if there had been no such preliminary boring. It
remains only to effect the junction of the new and old feather.
Before attempting this, dip the shaft of the new piece into the
vinegar, and also moisten the end of the old feather just above
the place where it has been cut. Then taking the imping-needle,
push one half of it into the pith of the new piece of feather, and
the other half into that of the old. By this means the two will
necessarily become one and the same feather. Be sure, as you
push the two together, that their flat surfaces are level with one
another, and not inclined at different angles. When the new
end is pushed home up to the old amputated shaft, it will fit on
to it, and the web on both sides will meet and form a uniform
surface. Then release the hawk and replace her, still hooded,
on the screen-perch, where she must be left quite quiet. It is a
good plan to do the imping in the evening, so that very soon
afterwards the hawk will naturally be ready to go to sleep; and
if the hood is to be left on, her last meal should, of course, have
been without castings. If not, the room where her perch is
should be darkened. She is less likely, when in the dark or
hooded, to meddle with the mended feather; and when it has
been left alone for twelve hours, the needle will have begun to
rust in the pith of it, and thus be firmly stuck fast at both ends.</p>

<p>When skilfully and neatly performed, the operation of
imping not only replaces effectually the part of a feather which
has become useless, but repairs the mischief so thoroughly that
no trace whatever remains of any injury having ever been done
to it. I have known feathers so imped that the eye could not
discern the place of juncture, and it was difficult even to discover
it by passing the thumb-nail down the shaft of the imped
feather. The tenacity of the rusted iron keeps the needle
immovably in its place; and an imped feather, if it afterwards
breaks at all, will break more readily in any part of it than near
the place where the juncture has been made. Of course the
smaller the hawk the more difficult is the operation. Merlins
are particularly troublesome, owing to their vivacity and the
smallness of their feathers. It is, however, quite possible for an
experienced imper to mend up one of these tiny hawks, even
without an assistant to help him in holding her down.</p>

<p>The falconer should keep by him, in a box or drawer where
they are safe from moths, a few feathers in readiness for imping
the kind of hawks which he flies. When he is in the habit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">« 230 »</a></span>
moulting them he will be able to supply his needs by saving up
the long feathers dropped in the moult. These should be so
stowed away that it is possible to identify the year in which
they were dropped; for it is not advisable to use a very old
feather, as it may be brittle, and crack in pieces round the
needle. A spare tail feather or two of any of the hawks which
are most commonly trained may often be begged from a brother-falconer.
But when a ger, saker, or one of the rarer falcons
needs imping, it may be necessary to purchase a whole skin,
which will entail some trouble and expense. It should be
noted that there is one exception to the rule that a feather
from any one kind of hawk must not be used for one of another
kind. This is when the broken feather is to be imped merely
for the purpose of the moult. Whenever hawks are moulting,
the new feathers, as they come down, must be protected on each
side by others of at least equal length to those of the natural
plumage. But unless the hawk is being flown while she moults,
it is immaterial whether the new feather matches the others in
shape or colour. If it is long enough, and of about equal
breadth, it will serve the required purpose. But every hawk
before going into moult should be well set up in feathers of
one kind or other, which are of a proper length and sufficient
strength. A new feather, while growing down, needs more
protection than any other.</p>

<p>If a feather is broken so high up that the shaft at the place
of fracture is hollow, there are at least two ways in which it
may be mended. The simplest is to slit the shaft on its under
side, and then, cutting off the base of the new feather which is
intended to be used, push the latter in bodily to the hollow of
the old shaft. When it is far enough in, pass a small needle with
strong waxed thread right through both quills, starting from
below, and, winding the two ends of the thread round the quills
in opposite directions, tie tightly together underneath the
feather. When the feather is big enough there may be two such
lashings of thread, one a little lower down than the other. A
second plan, which is known as plugging, consists in first stuffing
up the hollow quill, of the injured feather, above where it has
been cut through, with a chunk of some feather which is not
hollow, but has a solid pith. The plug thus inserted is firmly
fixed in by means of some glutinous compound. When it has
had time to become immovably settled in its place the imping
can be done with an imping-needle in the ordinary way, the
new piece of feather having been plugged also in a similar way,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">« 231 »</a></span>
if necessary. If a feather should have been pulled out, base
and all, it is advisable to put some solid grease into the place,
to keep it from closing up and preventing the new feather from
growing down.</p>

<p>When only the tip of a wing feather is gone it would of
course be only for the sake of appearances that it would be
imped. Considering that wild hawks, and some trained ones
also, kill quarry while they are moulting, and have four or more
of their biggest feathers wanting, or only half-grown, at the
same time, it would be a bad hawk which could not fly passably
because she was short of an inch square of the sail area she
ought to spread. Occasionally, as for instance when you have
not long to wait before the moult will begin, you may leave a
hawk unimped though she is very ragged. But the worst of
allowing any feather to remain with its end off is that the next
feathers to it, especially in the tail, are pretty sure to go too.
The strain which the tail has to bear is such as it can just resist
by the collective strength of all the feathers together; but when
one is unable to take its full share of the resistance, the others
are unequal to the pressure, and give way. What difference in
a hawk&rsquo;s flying power does the loss of a whole feather or half
a feather imply? It is, of course, quite impossible to say. But
arguing from the analogy of pigeons, the tails of which are sometimes
removed in order to increase their speed, it would seem that
in mere straight-forward flying the tail is of very small assistance.
I once had an eyess jack-merlin sent to me from the nest in a
deplorable condition. The tail was clogged at the end with
dirt, and so many of the tail feathers were bent and broken that
he was at once christened &ldquo;Tagrag&rdquo;; and while he was at hack
was regarded as unworthy of much attention. By the time he
was ready to enter, his tail, which it had not been thought
worth while to mend, was reduced to about half its proper
length, more than an inch having been knocked off every one
of the feathers. This hawk developed later on into the fastest
hawk I ever saw. When he was out on his own account, as he
was once for seven days together, he could be distinguished from
a wild merlin less by the stumpy tail than by the headlong
speed with which he flew, even when not in pursuit of anything.
When engaged in a double flight he would put in about three
stoops to two of the other hawk; and these were not only
more quickly made, but were longer, straighter, and more telling.
This hawk was an exceptionally good one. He was the
brother (though senior by a year) of Queen and Jubilee, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">« 232 »</a></span>
between them killed 200 larks, in single flights, in one season.
He was therefore no doubt naturally a very fast hawk; but I
mention him in order to show how little difference, in his case,
was made in his flying power by the loss of nearly half a tail.
I have also flown merlins at the lure, when in course of being
broken to the hood, with their tails tied up, and noticed how
admirably they stoop and throw up, without apparently being
incommoded by the temporary inability to spread out their tails.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Much more serious and alarming than the breakage of a
feather is the fracture of a bone. When the hawk is a favourite,
a cure is often attempted, and occasionally with success. I have
known a peregrine to be shot at and brought down with a
broken wing, and to recover without any treatment at all; but
this was no doubt a very exceptional case. Usually any grave
damage to the wing, whether by way of a sprain or a fracture,
is incurable. The bones of the leg are more get-at-able, more
easily set, and subjected, when set, to less strain than those of
the wing. Splints and bandages should be applied (though it
is very difficult to adjust a bandage to the wing) under the
direction and advice, if possible, of some person who has a good
practical knowledge of surgery. The hawk, after being operated
upon, should be placed in a sock as described in
<a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter <span class="smcap">V</span>.</a>,
and fed by the hand with strips of washed meat or light food
without castings. Before the sock is put on it must be ascertained
that the injured limb has been placed in the natural
position; and every precaution must be taken that the patient
is left undisturbed, so that it is impossible, or at least unlikely,
that she should displace the setting which has been attempted.</p>

<p>Hawks are sometimes troubled with a weakness in the outer
joint of the wing, causing the outer part of it, where the primaries
are, to droop. The affection is more or less pronounced in
different cases, sometimes being so severe that the wing seems
to hang down powerless, as if merely hooked on loosely at the
joint, and at other times merely to be a little out of place and
to be carried slightly lower than the other. Occasionally the
weakness is so great that the hawk cannot fly, while at other
times, after perhaps wobbling a little when thrown off, the
hawk, once fairly on the wing, seems to fly almost or quite as
well as if there was nothing the matter. Generally a hawk
which is so affected keeps hitching up the bad wing, as it were,
into its proper place, only to find it droop again in a few
minutes into its old position. The old writers, who were well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">« 233 »</a></span>
acquainted with the symptoms, say that the injury is one which
must have arisen from a blow received by the hawk; but I
have known it come on suddenly at a time when the sufferer
could hardly have come by such an accident without its being
observed. The following is a prescription given by Turbervile
for curing the malady:&mdash;&ldquo;Master Cassian (a Greek falconer of
Rhodes) sayeth that yee must take Sage, Myntes, and Pelamountaine,
and boyle them all togyther in a new earthen pot
full of good wyne, and when they bee well sodden, take the potte
and set it uppon hotte imbers as close stopped as maye bee.
Then make a rounde hole of the bygnesse of an Apple in the
clothe that your potte is stopped withal for the steam to issue
out at. Which done, take your Hawke upon your fiste and holde
out hir hurte wing handsomely a great whyle over the hole, that
it may take the fume whiche steameth up out of the potte.
Afterwarde lette hir be well dryed by keeping hir warme by
the fire, for if she should catche sodaine cold upon it, it would
becomme woorse than it was before. Use her thus twyce a daye
for three or foure dayes togyther, and shee shall bee recovered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The beak and nares of a hawk should be kept clean, and a
good falconer will, after she has finished her meal, wipe off any
remnants of food or blood which may remain attached to the
upper mandible. Unless this is done&mdash;sometimes, indeed, in
spite of its being done&mdash;the nostrils and upper parts of the
cere, where the feathers begin, may become infested with acari,
or mites, which, unless destroyed, will eat into the horn and
the flesh and cause great annoyance, if not actual sores and
inflamed ulcers. Hawks which are in low condition are particularly
subject to this pest; but at all times a sharp look-out
should be kept, so as to detect the presence of the minute
parasites, which may be seen running about somewhere near the
nostrils. Fortunately it is easy to get rid of them. A solution
of tobacco soaked in water should be made, and mixed with
brandy or some strong spirit, and then applied with a small
brush to the parts visited by the parasites. After a few applications
they will be found to have disappeared.</p>

<p>Hawks will often get corns on their feet if allowed to stand
constantly on hard blocks or perches. It is strange enough that
there should be found any falconers who have so little thought
for the comfort of their charges that they will use such resting-places.
The screen-perch, at all events, which is kept permanently
indoors, should have a padding of some kind&mdash;cloth,
baize, or soft leather&mdash;underneath the canvas or sacking upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">« 234 »</a></span>
which the hawk has to stand. One of the cruellest of all the
cruel things done in zoological gardens is the neglect to pad
the miserable perches provided for the birds of prey, which are
usually in consequence seen to have their feet adorned plentifully
with corns and deformities. What with bad food, bad
resting-places, and defective bathing accommodation, these poor
captives are usually types of what the falconer should wish that
his hawks may not become.</p>

<p>Of actual illnesses trained hawks undoubtedly have their
full share. The old books devote many lengthy chapters to
the description of these disorders, and of the remedies recommended
for them. How far the elaborate concoctions prescribed
by mediæval quacks and used, as it is to be presumed, by
their very credulous customers, were efficacious in curing the
evils for which they were prescribed, it is not easy to say. For
in modern times we do not put much faith in nostrums of any
such kind. But as the ancients certainly killed with their
hawks several species of quarry which we hardly attempt in
these days, it may not unreasonably be supposed that some of
their medicines were at least useful in stimulating the energies
of their patients, and inspiring them with a sort of artificial
courage such as the Asiatic falconers still impart by the use of
sal ammoniac and other powerful drugs. It is, I think, more
than probable that the hobby, which has not for a long time
past been successfully trained, was brought by physicking into
such condition that she would fly keenly and well, and deserved
the praises which some of the old writers lavish upon her. In
the palmy days of falconry it was not only when a hawk was
actually ill that physic was given. If she did not acquit herself
in the field with all the credit expected by her trainer, he dosed
her almost as a matter of course. Remedies of a more or less
fanciful kind were supposed to exist for almost every failing
which hawk-flesh is heir to; and the medicine-cupboard of a
falconer who professed to know anything about physicking his
charges must have contained as many herbs, spices, powders,
decoctions, and tinctures as would stock a small druggist&rsquo;s shop.
As far as I know, no modern falconer has had the patience or temerity
to test the value of these multifarious pills and potions.</p>

<p>The state of health of a hawk may be ascertained by various
signs, more or less infallible. Mutes, castings, and the general
demeanour furnish the most obvious symptoms; but the books,
which bestow a vast amount of attention upon the two former,
are much too silent as to the latter and more subtle indication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">« 235 »</a></span>
of an incipient malady. The falconer should always observe
the colour of every hawk&rsquo;s mutes. If she is kept for any long
time at a stretch upon a screen-perch under which the sawdust
or sand is so thickly strewn as to absorb them altogether, a
piece of paper must be placed occasionally under the perch,
which will enable him to make the necessary inspection. And
at the first appearance of anything wrong the proper remedy
should be applied. The mutes of a hawk in good health should
be of an almost uniform bright white colour, and of the consistency
of the whiting with which a lawn-tennis ground is
usually marked out. If there are specks of black in them there
is no cause for alarm, but these should not be abundant or
large in size. If any other colour is to be seen there is something
amiss; and if the mutes are either watery or too thick the
hawk is not in proper health. The sooner these symptoms are
detected and the right steps taken the easier will be the cure;
and in most cases a diet of freshly-killed birds given in moderation
twice a day will set matters right without any resort to strong
measures. If, however, the discoloration is great, and appears
suddenly, a dose should be at once given before the sufferer
loses her appetite and becomes unable to retain food or anything
else in her crop.</p>

<p>Castings are easily found under the perch or round the
block, though when hawks are tied very near to one another on
the same screen-perch it is sometimes difficult enough to know
which of them has thrown a casting which is picked up between
her and her neighbour. The appearance of them should always
be noticed before they are thrown away. They should be more
or less egg-shaped and compact, with no great amount of oily
matter adhering to the outside. The colour should be rather
darker than that of the feathers, fur, wool, or whatever else has
been taken to form the casting; and if it is not so, it is a sign
that the crop is foul. A hawk in good health should also cast
within a reasonable time after the casting has been swallowed;
and otherwise you may suspect that the gorge is clogged. A
hawk which has been fed late even in a summer evening should
throw up her casting before eight at latest on the following
morning. When a hawk is slow at casting, she should be
carried a bit, and will then often cast on the fist, or immediately
upon being put off it on to the block. A wild merlin will often
eat the whole of a small bird between 8 and 9 a.m., put it over
by about 2 p.m., cast, and then begin to look out for the
evening meal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">« 236 »</a></span></p>

<p>A trained hawk may cast well and have fairly good mutes,
and yet be all the better for a small dose. If she has a dull
eye and stands stolidly on her block without taking notice of
passing birds; if she eats without zest, or flies without animation;
if, when standing on the fist, she takes a weak grip with
her feet, or puffs out her feathers without cause, or folds her
wings loosely together, she may indeed be healthy enough to
get a doctor&rsquo;s certificate, but she is not in the sort of fettle to
do herself justice in the field. In such case do not, like some
falconers who ought to know better, begin calling the hawk
names, and neglect her, while bestowing extra attention upon
one which exhibits more aptitude. Remember that in the wild
state there is no such thing as a bad hawk. All find their living,
even in the worst weather, and find it although continually
plagued and thwarted by the knowledge that if they go within
gunshot of a man they will probably be murdered. Cannot a
trained hawk, well housed and regularly fed, and freed from the
constant fear of gun and trap, be made as fast and as clever even
as the worst of her wild brethren? Falconers must be a long
way behind the professors of other arts and crafts if they cannot
make their trained pets at least nearly as good as the wild
and untrained. There is perhaps more delight in flying a hawk
which is never out of sorts and always naturally ready to do
her best. But it is more creditable to the trainer, and a greater
test of his skill, if he can impart excellence where he found
little sign of it, and in short make a bad hawk fly well. The
Indian native falconers&mdash;from whom, by the way, we have a lot
to learn&mdash;habitually fly some of their favourite hawks, such as
the saker, under the stimulus of strong drugs; and there can
be no doubt that many hawks of all species are bettered by
frequent dosing, just as a Chinaman by opium, and certain
literary celebrities by absinthe. In some cases these doses
supply more or less effectually the lack of exercise from which
a trained hawk suffers, and in other cases possibly they act as
an antidote to the feeling of annoyance and discontent arising
from captivity and confinement.</p>

<p>As to the particular remedy to be applied when a bird is
thus out of sorts without being absolutely ill, I fear the reader
must be referred to one of the old text-books, and not alarmed
by quotations at length from their well-garnished pages. The
mischief proceeds, of course, either from excessive cold or
excessive heat in the system, which will require consequently
either heating or cooling medicine. For the former purpose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">« 237 »</a></span>
spices and peppers will be preferred, with fatty substances, such
as oil or bacon; while for the latter, purgatives may be used, and
meat washed in the juice of certain vegetable products, such as
endive, cucumber, or melon. If the malady is so strong as to
amount to fever, the hawk&rsquo;s feet may be bathed with water
distilled from lettuce, plantain, or nightshade, or the juice of
henbane. If, however, the earliest symptoms are noted, it will
generally serve all purposes to give hot feeds, <i>i.e.</i> birds just
killed, in the case of cold, and washed meat in the case of
too great heat. Those who are not content to wait for such
symptoms, but prefer a prophylactic treatment, may perhaps be
satisfied with the following prescription: &ldquo;If you intend to
keepe and maintayne your Falcons and all other Hawkes in
health, take Germander, Pelamountayne, Basill, Grimel-sede, and
Broome flowers, of each of them halfe an ownce; of Isop, of
Saxifrage, of Polipodic, and of Horse-mintes, of each of them
a quarter of an ownce; of Nutmegges, a quarter of an ownce;
of Cucubes, Borage, Mummy, Mogemort, Sage, of the four
kinds of Mirobolans, Indorum, Kabulorum, Beliricorum, and
Embelicorum, of each of them halfe an ownce; of Saffron, an
ownce; and of Aloes Cicotrine, the fifth part of an ownce. All
these things confect to a powder, and at every eygth day, or
at every twelfth day, give your Hawkes (the big ones, that is)
the quantitie of a beane of it with their meate. And if they
will not take it so, put it in a Henne&rsquo;s gutte, tied at both ends, or
else after some other meanes, so as ye cause them to receive it
downe; and lette them stand emptie one houre after.&rdquo; A more
simple preventive medicine is Aloes Cicotrine alone, given
every eighteen days as an emetic, just after the hawk has cast,
and followed in two hours&rsquo; time by a warm meal.</p>

<p>Coming now to specific maladies, the commonest and
not the least dangerous of the complaints to which trained
hawks are subject is the &ldquo;croaks&rdquo; or &ldquo;kecks,&rdquo; an affection
of the throat akin to what is called bronchitis in
the human patient. Its existence is betrayed by a wheezing
or hoarseness, noticeable as the hawk breathes. In
slight cases the sound is scarcely audible, and only very
occasionally; but when the attack is a bad one, the breath is
impeded, and the invalid appears to be suffering from a sort of
asthma. These severe attacks sometimes come on suddenly in
bad weather, and generally prove fatal; but the milder attacks,
if attended to in time, may often be mastered and vanish permanently.
The cause is usually the same as that which would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">« 238 »</a></span>
in men induce a cold in the head or throat,&mdash;a chill caused
by sudden changes of temperature, excessive cold, or, most
frequently of all, excessive damp. The remedy is to put the
sufferer in a warm and dry place, and to give the most palatable
and nourishing food in moderate quantities at reasonably
short intervals, with a peppercorn or mustard-seed now and
then. Freshly-killed birds are the best diet; but if sheep&rsquo;s heart
or butcher&rsquo;s meat is given, it should be first warmed a little.
The hawk should not be left out of doors after midday, or in
a place exposed to the wind. Strangely enough, gers, whose
habitat is in more northern latitudes than any other hawks,
are the most susceptible of all to this malady; and special care
should be taken, therefore, that they are not allowed to be in
damp or draughty places.</p>

<p>Cramp is a terrible disorder, also caused by damp or cold.
It is specially apt to attack the short-winged hawks, and is, I
believe, always fatal. Eyess sparrow-hawks taken too early
from the nest are pretty sure to develop it when there is no
maternal wing to cover them at night. Possibly by keeping
them in an artificial nest in a warm place the mischief might be
averted; but the slightest chill seems to bring it on, and when
once it takes hold of the feet and legs it appears to paralyse
and permanently disable them. Beginning with a mere stiffness
in the joints, it increases in malignity until the sufferer
loses the use of one or more limbs, and then often paralyses the
muscles of the back. When the very first symptoms of anything
like stiffness appear in a goshawk or sparrow-hawk, no
matter of what age, she should be taken at once into quite a
warm place, and the affected limb fomented with hot water and
embrocations. Unless these remedies speedily give relief the
most humane thing to do is to put the hawk out of her misery at
once. In this matter not only is prevention better than cure,
it is the only means known of combating the dreaded disease.</p>

<p>Ague, or a low fever nearly resembling it, attacks hawks
much in the same way as human beings. There are shivering
fits and alternations of hot and cold, which may be discovered
by feeling the body with the hand. The cause is often exposure
to cold after becoming heated by flying or standing
in the sun, or confinement in a draughty or cold place. The
sufferer droops her wings, and looks miserable generally. She
should be put in a sheltered place, rather warm than cold, and
fed often, sparingly, on the best light food that is to be had.
When the hot or cold fit is on she should be left as quiet as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">« 239 »</a></span>
possible, but when it goes off she should be carried, and even
flown a little, if she will; and she should by no means be left
alone in any dismal place without company. When her attention
is occupied she will have less inclination to mope or give
way to the malady, and is much more likely to improve. If
the affection is obstinate and the hot fits frequent, about two
scruples of rhubarb may be given (for a falcon) in a casting
of cotton wool, followed after two or three hours by a moderate
meal of something freshly killed and light. If, however, the
shivering fits predominate, or the hawk has become low in condition
and has a poor appetite, the dose must be administered
with caution and in moderation, and the patient should be
coaxed and induced to take as much as she will, up to half a crop,
of some heating food, such as freshly-killed sparrows, which are
best of all, pigeons, or, in case of a goshawk, young rats; and if
at a subsequent meal a sheep&rsquo;s heart is given (which such hawks
can very easily pick at) it may be washed in wine in which has
been boiled sage, mint, cinnamon, cloves, or some such aromatic
herb. In all cases the invalid must be petted and made much
of until she has regained her robust health and appetite.</p>

<p>Apoplexy is no doubt the disorder most commonly fatal to
trained hawks of the short-winged varieties. It was called by
the ancients the falling evil, and it has carried off quite suddenly
many a first-rate goshawk almost without any warning at all.
And it is probably more to be feared in these days when the use
of washed meat has been so generally abandoned. The cause of
this effusion of blood on the brain is over-fulness of body or an
accumulation of internal fat; and in order to guard against it
care should be taken to avoid overfeeding a hawk with strong,
heating, or fattening viands. Merlins are also very subject to
apoplexy when short of exercise, and peregrines are by no
means exempt from it. When any hawk is fat or full-blooded,
any exposure to a hot sun, or any violent or unaccustomed exercise,
or bating off and hanging head downwards, may cause a
determination of blood to the brain; and death will follow without
the chance of even attempting a cure. It is well, therefore,
especially when any hawk is not taking daily exercise, and
plenty of it, not only to avoid overfeeding, but also from time
to time to give a purge and an emetic. One of the simplest
prescriptions is lard or butter, well washed, and then steeped in
rose-water, and given with a little powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Apostume of the head is called by Turbervile a &ldquo;monstrous
accident,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;very grievous evil,&rdquo; and said by him to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">« 240 »</a></span>
infectious. &ldquo;It is discerned by y<sup>e</sup> swelling of y<sup>e</sup> hawke&rsquo;s eyes, by
the moysture which sundrie tymes issueth and distilleth from the
eares, and often eake by evyll savoure and smell of the apostume.&rdquo;
The invalid is inert, and cares little for her food, and will not
pull at her tirings. The remedies he recommends are exceptionally
commonplace. First, butter, well washed in rose-water,
with honey of roses and powdered sugar. Then afterwards, for
the relief of her poor head, rue, 4 grains; Aloes Epatie, 2 drams;
saffron, 1 scruple, to be finely powdered and made into a pill
with honey of roses. If the ear is stopped up, clear it with lint
on a silver bodkin or needle, and, having infused warm oil of
sweet almonds, stop it with another piece of lint. Which failing
of success, he gives directions for cauterising, for which the
original, or some surgeon, should be consulted.</p>

<p>Another sort of swelling in the head which affects the nares
as well as the eyes, and is nothing else but a catarrh, may, it
seems, often be cured by a pill made of agaric, 2 scruples; cinnamon,
1; liquorice, 1, powdered and mixed with honey of roses.
The sufferer should be made to sneeze by giving her&mdash;not snuff,
as one might expect, but pepper, cloves, and mustard-seed,
powdered, and blown into the nares through a quill, or rubbed
on to the nares and palate. After these, or indeed any doses
have been administered, it is well to carry the hawk on the fist
till they have taken effect.</p>

<p>For suffusion of the eye a purge of aloes or agaric is recommended,
and local treatment by blowing the powder of aloes
and sugar-candy into the eye.</p>

<p>Frounce is a malady which will pronounce itself sometimes
without much apparent cause. The mucous membrane of the
mouth and throat is inflamed, and the tongue swelled and coated
with a brownish white matter. This coating should be scraped
off with a quill or silver knife, and the mouth dressed with burnt
alum and vinegar, or a weak solution of nitrate of silver. The
dressing may be done with a piece of lint on a small stick.
Another lotion is made by taking the leaves of woodbine, with
sage, honey, and alum, and seething them till the leaves are quite
soft, and straining the decoction through a cloth.</p>

<p>Inflammation of the crop may be the result of bad food
or neglect to give proper castings. The first signs of it will be
in the castings themselves, which may be discoloured or misshapen,
and sometimes charged with undigested food. In aggravated
cases the mutes may be reddish, and the hawk may often
throw up her food, and be unable to keep anything down. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">« 241 »</a></span>
purge and an emetic should be given before this stage is reached;
and great care must be taken not to overload the crop, or to
give anything which will nauseate the hawk. If the malady
has been neglected, it becomes dangerous and very difficult to
cure. The hawk wastes away, and it may be a long time before
you are able to restore her strength&mdash;if you pull her through
at all.</p>

<p>Pantas is an old name given to a malady of the liver, when
it becomes hot and dried up. The hawk is costive, and opens
her beak often, as if gasping for more air. The mutes are
blackish, thick, and scanty. Amongst numerous remedies in
vogue are olive oil, oil of sweet almonds, and sugar-candy, with
butter or lard, washed in rose-water. Of course no heating food
should be given, such as sparrows, rats, or old pigeons. Powdered
cloves and cubebes may be given in a casting every three
or four days. The liver is almost as apt to get out of order in
trained hawks as it is in untrained men. Green mutes, as well
as black ones, betray the mischief, and warn the falconer. A
purgative, such as those last mentioned, will be the first remedy;
but it must be followed by great care in the subsequent feeding.
A more fanciful remedy consists of snails steeped in asses'
milk, and used as a washing for sheep&rsquo;s heart, which is soaked
in it.</p>

<p>Megrim, or palsy, is denoted by a shaking of the hawk&rsquo;s
head. Pepper, aloes, and cloves may be given, with a little
washed lard.</p>

<p>When a hawk is troubled with worms she is fidgety, and has
startings and twitchings of the body, and falls away in condition.
Mustard-seed, aloes, and agaric are prescribed, and
cayenne pepper may be given with her food. Filanders are a
sort of worm more difficult to suspect, and more difficult to get
rid of. One remedy is garlic, long steeped in oil; and if this fails,
iron filings, with oil of bitter almonds, may be tried.</p>

<p>Hawks, if kept clean and frequently encouraged to bathe, are
not much troubled with parasites. Young merlins from the nest
are often infected with a flying tick, which does them no particular
harm, and usually disappears when the little hawks begin to bathe.
The way to get rid of them is to paint the body with a decoction
of tobacco mixed with brandy. This is also the remedy for
lice, which peregrines will sometimes get from a rook which they
have killed. The same wash is to be applied to the nares and
forehead of a hawk when troubled with mites. These very
minute insects&mdash;otherwise called acarus or formica&mdash;sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">« 242 »</a></span>
establish themselves in and near the nostrils, and may be seen
running about rapidly over the beak. They cause great annoyance,
and if not put an end to will eat into the horn of the beak,
and cause inflammation and other serious mischief. They dislike,
however, the tobacco wash, and cannot keep their ground
against it.</p>

<p>Corns and swelled feet are the result almost invariably of
standing on hard and unpadded blocks or perches. They are,
of course, both painful and also highly detrimental to the efficiency
of a hawk, whose feet as a weapon of attack are only
second in importance to her wings. The corn must be cut out, or
the inflamed swelling lanced, and the foot must be bathed with
some lotion, such as white of egg, vinegar, and rose-water, or
with tincture of iodine. A very well-padded perch must be
used afterwards, and a fortifying lotion frequently applied. Inflammation
is sometimes set up by the prick of a thorn, when a
hawk has trod upon a bramble, or grasped it when making a grab
at a quarry which has put into a hedge. The worst form of
corn is called &ldquo;pin,&rdquo; and is pointed like a nail. Lancing and
lotions may cure it; but it is an obstinate complaint, often
incurable; and the various unguents prescribed by ancient
authors seem none of them to have been used with any great
success.</p>

<p>When a claw or talon is broken by any accident, the falconer
is advised to apply to it a plaster made of the gallbladder
of a fowl, and to fit a sort of collar round the hawk&rsquo;s
neck to act as a guard, so that she cannot touch the place with
her beak. The same thing may be done when a hawk has a
wound or sore on the foot, and keeps picking at it, a practice
not uncommon with merlins, which will actually eat away their
own feet.</p>

<p>The blain is a watery vesicle in the second joint of the wing.
It should be lanced, and the hawk kept quiet until the wing is
strong again.</p>

<p>For a &ldquo;snurt,&rdquo; or cold in the head, Bert recommends the root
of wild primrose dried in an oven and powdered. The powder
is to be blown into the nares of the hawk. Or the leaves of the
wild primrose may be distilled, and the nares bathed with the
juice.</p>

<p>Craye is a stoppage in the &ldquo;tewel,&rdquo; or lower bowel. It is said
that the meat should be washed in distilled haws, or a decoction
of primprivet, or drawn through milk warm from the cow.</p>

<p>Rye is a swelling in the head, which is said to be produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">« 243 »</a></span>
by keeping the hawk without hot meat, and is cured in the way
which may be conjectured.</p>

<p>Prynne is a malady of the eyes, for which it is recommended
to bathe them with the juice of daisy leaves, or a decoction of
powdered egg-shell, yolk of hard-boiled egg, and a quarter as
much rock alum.</p>

<p>For a bruise Bert advises clarified honey, boiled with half as
much stone pitch.</p>

<p>Some old writers declare that a hawk&rsquo;s appetite may be improved
by steeping her meat in claret and the yolk of an egg; that
when she is slow at casting, or in digesting her food, she should
have a mustard-seed made up with honey into a pill. In such
cases she should certainly have plenty of tirings; and fresh water
should be kept within her reach, so that she may sip it at any
time if so inclined. Sweet things are good for a goshawk, which
is something of a sweet-tooth. A good scouring for a sparrow-hawk
is pounded sugar-candy and butter mixed with beef.
Sugar-candy and olive oil are both good purgatives for getting
rid of the internal fat or grease. For giving a tone to the
stomach, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger are beneficial. And the most
celebrated of all ingredients for compounding hawk medicines
is &ldquo;mummy.&rdquo; One very distinguished modern falconer, having
read in the ancient books endless references to this medicament,
wrote to another equally distinguished authority to ask, &ldquo;What is
mummy?&rdquo; The answer, which is too good not to be repeated
here, was, &ldquo;Mummy is mummy.&rdquo; That is perhaps as much as
the greatest Egyptologist can say!</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Moulting</span></p>


<p>A most important period in the life of any hawk arrives
when she begins to undergo the ordeal of moulting.
The annual or biennial change of plumage which occurs
naturally in almost all birds affects more or less powerfully
their health and condition, robbing them for the time of a
certain amount of their strength and vigour, as well as depriving
them of a part of the actual mechanical apparatus which
serves as their means of locomotion. Thus we have seen that
skylarks, when putting on a new set of feathers in August, are
very much less able to escape from a hawk than when that
process has been completed. To the hawk, whose very subsistence
depends mainly upon his flying powers, it is obvious
that the loss of any big feathers in the wing must be at least a
very serious inconvenience, especially if it is combined with a
weakening of the whole bodily organism. Nature has not,
therefore, allowed the young hawk to mate or breed until
after the first moult. At the time when he or she would
naturally be busied with family cares&mdash;that is, when she is
nearly a year old&mdash;the minor but still formidable effort of
moulting is deemed a sufficient trial. Only when, after
assuming the adult plumage, she has kept herself through the
whole of a second winter is she called upon to undertake the
arduous task of feeding not only herself, but also two or three
ravenous and helpless youngsters. The first moult of the young
hawk is also arranged to take place at that time of year when
it is least difficult for her to find her own living. While the
big feathers of her nestling plumage are falling out and being
slowly replaced by new ones, the bird world is full of newly-fledged
quarry, or at least of quarry which are not yet very
strong upon the wing. In other words, the moulting of hawks
naturally takes place in summer, just when they are most able
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">« 245 »</a></span>
to dispense with a part of their flying apparatus and of their
energy.</p>

<p>Wild hawks vary a good deal in the date at which they
drop their first feather, but trained hawks can be made to vary
still more. Experience soon showed that a certain diet and
regimen would hurry on the moult and expedite its progress,
whereas another would defer and protract it. The young
falconer will reflect betimes which of these treatments will best
suit his plans, and act accordingly, remembering that, having
once decided, he cannot without great inconvenience and even
some risk adopt a different system. In any event he will,
except in the case of rook-hawks, find himself in some difficulty,
for the moulting process is in any case a long one. It
is reckoned by months rather than by weeks. In peregrines,
which are notoriously slow and bad moulters, it may last a
half-year. If ever it is completed in three months the falconer
may think himself lucky; and the worst of it is, that the moulting
months generally include August and September. The
earliest day on which a feather can be dropped is usually well
on in March or often early in April, and this is in the case of
eyesses, for the passage hawks can hardly be induced to begin
till a good deal later. Unless, therefore, the falconer can hurry
the feathers down, he will hardly get his hawk even through
the moult, and far less ready for active work, by September 1.
We shall see, moreover, that the faster the moulting process is
pushed on the less fit will the hawk be at the end of it to
immediately take the field.</p>

<p>It is thus, in at least nine cases out of ten, practically
impossible to fly a hawk in full plumage at rooks in the spring,
and afterwards to fly the same hawk also in full plumage at
game in August or September. And whether she has been
flown in the early part of the year or not, it is still
almost equally difficult to so arrange that she shall fly in
full feather in the early part of the game season. Hence it is
that an eyess of the year, when flown as soon as she is fully
trained, comes usually into the field better equipped in the way
of feathers than what may be called her elders and betters.
Occasionally the moult of a passage hawk, or even adult eyess,
can be deferred until August or even September, but this result
is not to be reckoned upon with any certainty. The youthful
grouse or partridges and their rather hard-worked parents, the
adolescent or moulting lark, and inexperienced blackbird, ought
all to be a little grateful to Dame Nature for having ordained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">« 246 »</a></span>
that they should be pitted against hawks which are either
young themselves or else have to take the air with shortened
sail.</p>

<p>Many modern falconers, abandoning all attempts to fully
moult their hawks in time for the game season, fly them
irrespectively of the condition in which their feathers may be.
That is to say, instead of shutting up their hawk, as the old
falconers commonly did, when she drops the first feather, and
keeping her inactive in the mews until the last new one has
come down, they simply go on giving her her daily exercise
just as if nothing had happened, and almost, if not quite, ignore
the moult. It is wonderful how well some hawks acquit themselves
under such disadvantageous conditions, and how little
difference to a really fast and clever flyer is made by the loss
of even two of the biggest feathers in each wing. On the other
hand, a slow hawk, especially if she is not over-gifted with
brains, so as to be able to make her head save her wings, is
apt to cut rather a poor figure when flown in the middle of the
moult at grouse. One of the chief drawbacks incident to this
plan&mdash;especially with peregrines&mdash;is that when flying hard they
often moult so badly. Full feeding&mdash;or rather overfeeding&mdash;is
necessary to many trained hawks if they are to moult fast and
well; and, of course, when expected to fly in the field they
cannot exactly be overfed. Well fed, even to the verge of
excessive generosity, they must be, or the new feathers will
come down narrow and weak, or even the moult may cease.
But to overfeed a passage hawk before putting her up to wait
on, is to court the loss of her. Consequently the falconer who
flies grouse with a falcon in the moult is confronted with an
awkward dilemma. If he keeps his hawk sharp-set he is quite
likely to see her leave off moulting, at least for a time, beginning
again perhaps later on, and thus protracting the moulting season
to an unconscionable length. If, on the other hand, he attempts
to keep her fat, he may be pretty sure that she will be disobedient
and slow at coming to the lure, and he will be
tormented by a constant fear that she will despise it altogether
and choose her own place in which to moult at liberty.</p>

<p>Suppose, however, that the falconer, having flown his eyess
through the game season or his passage hawk through the rook-hawking
season, desires to get her into moult as quickly as
possible and through it without delay. While still flying her to
the lure for exercise he will take care that she is bountifully
dealt with in the matter of rations. He will reserve for her one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">« 247 »</a></span>
of the most cosy places in the hawk-house; and when she sits
out at her block he will be specially careful that she is never
exposed to uncomfortable draughts or damp or chilly winds.
He will encourage her to bathe, in the open air if it is fine and
warm, or indoors if the weather is bad, and will, if necessary,
take the chill off the bath water. He will carry her often and
give her tirings, and, in short, make rather a pet of her; and
one morning, as he comes up to her place on the screen-perch,
he will espy beneath it a big broad feather shaped rather like
the blade of a butter-knife. This will be the seventh feather of
one of the moulter&rsquo;s wings. Sticking it into his hat, presently
to be transferred to a rack on the wall, which will hold the
remaining big feathers as they drop, he will then carry off my
lady to her quarters in the moulting-room.</p>

<p>This apartment, in the words of a high authority, should be
so &ldquo;cleane, handsome, and well kept, that your hawke may
rejoyce and delight greatly in it.&rdquo; We may perhaps have our
doubts whether any hawk would delight as much in the most
palatial prison-house as in the fresh air of the least picturesque
mountain or forest; but, at anyrate, a clean, cheerful, and
well-lighted room pleases her better than a dismal garret. A
well-ordered moulting-room is a somewhat luxurious apartment,
and cannot be provided without some trouble and
expense. It should not be cramped in size, but big enough to
allow the hawk at least to stretch her wings in a short flight
from one end of it to the other. The walls should have no
projecting corners, and if they are hung with some soft protecting
stuff it will be all the better. The windows&mdash;except in
those very commendable cases where the room is lighted by a
skylight&mdash;will be guarded on the inside by perpendicular bars
of smooth wood or cane; and the floor will be laid at least more
than an inch deep with sawdust or dry sand. Fixed upright
into the floor will be a block or two, with padded top; and the
room, near its two ends, nearest and farthest from the window,
will be crossed by perches, one of which at least should also be
well padded. If it is intended that the hawk, or hawks, for which
the room is designed shall be left mostly alone in solitary occupation,
a bath may be left on the floor; but, as in any case the
bath must be emptied and refilled pretty often by some person
entering the room, it may be as well to let the bath, when
unused, remain outside, where it can be kept clean instead of
dirty. The door of the moulting-room should open outwards;
and it is a good plan to make it close of its own accord by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">« 248 »</a></span>
weight or spring, to minimise the chance of its being inadvertently
left open.</p>

<p>Goshawks should never be moulted in company, and the
bigger falcons only when known to be good-tempered, and that
with a companion of the same sex. Tiercels, unless especially
cantankerous, may moult in the same room, and the same
thing may be said of female sparrow-hawks. All the other
small hawks may moult in company with others of the same
sex. In fact, in the case of merlins and kestrels there is no
harm in associating the two sexes, provided all occupants of
the club-room are kept, as they should be, constantly provided
with plenty of food. I am, however, disposed to think that
when merlins are loose together a good deal of chevying about
takes place, which is apt to be dangerous to the growing
feathers when the moult is nearly over.</p>

<p>The moulting-room should never be cold, and still less
damp. In very wet and chilly weather artificial heat may be
used in moderation. For instance, there may be a small fire in
the room underneath, or the flue of a lighted fire may pass up
one of the sides of the room itself. The window also should by
all means face the south rather than the north. The moult is
quicker and better when a hawk is kept warm, whereas anything
like a chill may check, or at least retard, it seriously.
Yet there is, of course, a difference between warmth and
stuffiness. Of the two evils, however, I am inclined to believe,
with the ancients, that over-ventilation is worse than over-closeness&mdash;if,
at least, you are anxious to get quickly through
with the moult.</p>

<p>The food for a moulting hawk should be nutritious without
being too heavy. It should be good and very plentiful. In
fact, the bird should be able to eat whenever she has a fancy to,
and to eat as much as she will. Accordingly, each time that
rations are served out they should be ample to last until the
next supply will be forthcoming. In quality the viands may
be rich and high-flavoured, if the hawk can stomach them.
John Barr moulted a falcon in an exceedingly short space of
time by supplying her constantly with the heads, necks, and
pinions of fat ducks, keeping her mostly under a small tented
shelter, upon the outside of which a summer sun beat down
with almost ferocious force. He declared that the feathers,
nourished by the fat contained in these succulent meals, came
down broader and stronger, as well as faster, than he had ever
known in other instances. Thus a &ldquo;grene goose&rdquo; was anciently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">« 249 »</a></span>
recommended for moulting hawks&rsquo; diet, and on the same principle
an ideal food for moulting merlins or sparrow-hawks
would be fat quails. These little hawks are, however, often
nauseated by eating birds which are very fat. The heads,
necks, and pinions of fowls should always be given freely to
moulting hawks, not only because the meat on them is of a
good kind, but because they make capital tirings, and so
provide exercise at a time when exercise is very difficult to
find. Mice for the small hawks, rats for goshawks, and rabbits
for the other big hawks, should also be often supplied; and
plenty of castings should be given, or the internal fat which
accumulates in a moulting hawk will either rob her of her
appetite or cause some obstinate and perhaps dangerous disorder.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the ancient falconers, who
were so fond of physicking their hawks, could omit to discover
artificial methods of expediting the moult. A couple of
specimens of fashionable prescriptions may be worth quoting
for just what they are worth: &ldquo;When ye meane to further the
mewing of your hawke, take of the snayles that have shelles,
stampe them shelles and all, strayning them through a cloth,
and with the oyle that comes thereof wash hir meate two or
three tymes. Also take of the snayles that lie in running
streames, give your hawke of them in the morning; for that
will both scowre hir and nourish hir greatly, and setteth hir up
and maketh hir to mew apace. Master Michelin, in his <i>Book
of the King of Cyprus</i>, sayeth thus: &lsquo;Cut an adder in two parts
and seeth him in water, and with that water and wheate togither
fede your pullets, pigeons, turtles, and other birds which you
intend to allow your hawkes that are slack to mewe, and soone
after they shall mewe their feathers apace.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The personal attention paid to a moulting hawk varies very
widely. Some falconers make frequent visits to the room, and
habituate the captive to come to the fist, and be carried and
handled and maintained in a very tame state. The ancient
falconers&mdash;and some of our own time&mdash;gave themselves very
little trouble, and left the moulting hawks pretty much to
their own devices. Probably the one course has nearly as
much to commend it as the other. It seems more amiable and
business-like to keep up, even during the off-season, that
friendly intercourse with your hawk which is natural among
friends, and even some of those habits of obedience which you
have so laboriously taught. On the other hand, while you are
giving your hawk a holiday, you may almost as well give her a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">« 250 »</a></span>
real one as do it by halves. She will very possibly moult a
little quicker, perhaps a little better, if she has no worry at all,
and can concentrate her whole energies upon the mere growing
of feathers, just as she did when in the nest, instead of having
to bother herself about jumping to the fist&mdash;a mere perfunctory
act of meaningless duty, devoid of practical use or result.</p>

<p>The falconer will, at least once a day, visit the moulting-room,
if it is only for the purpose of changing the bath water,
clearing away the castings and the stray feathers of birds that
have been plucked and eaten, and gathering up any feathers
which may have been dropped by the hawk herself. The order
in which these feathers fall is admirably arranged, so that each
new feather as it successively appears in the place of one that
has dropped out finds itself between two completely grown
feathers, either old or new, one on each side, between which it
can grow down with a protector right and left of it. The
deck feathers, <i>i.e.</i> the central feathers of the tail, are the first
to drop, and in the wings the &ldquo;beam&rdquo; or longest feathers are
about the latest to fall. By this time the smaller feathers of
the body and other parts will have mostly been changed. By
rights, of course, the change should be universal and complete,
but in peregrines and lanners it is often not so. Very commonly
one of the former may be seen with several brown feathers
interspersed among the light grey plumage of the first moult.
A falconer must be rather over-fastidious if he is put out at
this; but there is more reason for complaint when rusty-looking
primaries, well worn in the nestling stage of existence,
persist in keeping their places amongst the brand-new shafts
and webs of flight feathers just come down. A blue hawk thus
parti-coloured, looks as if there was something wrong with her;
and the owner is apt to fancy, whether rightly or wrongly I
cannot say, that the old feathers abnormally left in are not as
serviceable as new ones would have been. At anyrate, most
falconers consider it rather a feather in their cap to have their
hawks &ldquo;clean moulted,&rdquo; that is to say, with a complete suit of
new feathers on their bodies.</p>

<p>Occasionally it happens that without any apparent reason
an eyess drops out some of her nestling feathers almost as soon
as they have come fully down, or, as the old falconers termed it,
as soon as she is &ldquo;summed.&rdquo; I have known a jack-merlin, well
hacked and fully trained, and in first-rate condition, drop his
two deck feathers while sitting quietly on the pole-cadge on
the way to be flown in the field, and have seen him just afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">« 251 »</a></span>
fly as well as ever, and give a good account of a ringing
lark. When any such little mishap occurs the hawk must of
course be kept as high fed and fat as he can be consistently
with proper obedience. The jack I speak of found himself, in
consequence of his misfortune, promoted to a position of special
favour among his fellows. An extra allowance of the best sort
of food was daily permitted to him. When he flew well&mdash;which,
by the way, he always did&mdash;he had nearly as much as he liked
to eat. And when by reason of this very high feeding he
refused to come to the dead lure, a lark was generally walked
up by beaters driving towards him as he sat on a rick, so that
he might be indulged with the flight for which his vain little
soul was longing. Or, if this could not be done, he was left on
his self-chosen perch until one of the other hawks went up after
a ringing lark, when he would come up like a meteor across the
sky, and join in, sometimes to the great chagrin of the other
hawk, which had started under the impression that she was to
have the field to herself. In due course the new feathers grew
down, having the pretty blue-grey hue of the adult plumage,
and thus contrasting conspicuously with the five brown feathers
on either side of them. Before the lark season was over they
were fully down; and my lord was quite a curiosity, looking
rather as if some waggish under-falconer had imped the two
middle feathers of his tail with a couple of wood-pigeon&rsquo;s feathers
instead of the proper ones.</p>

<p>A hawk which has once been moulted in captivity is said
to be &ldquo;intermewed.&rdquo; When the moulting hawk, which has been
mewed in the old-fashioned way to get through the process, is
&ldquo;summed&rdquo; with her new suit, the falconer must not suppose
that the troubles of the ordeal are over. Before the newly bedizened
beauty can be flown again with any success she must
be got into condition, and, if suffered to get wild during her long
incarceration, she must undergo a fresh ordeal of reclamation.
The old falconers give elaborate directions for conditioning a
hawk when &ldquo;drawn&rdquo; from the mews. It would be more tedious
than profitable to reproduce their prescriptions, most of which
recommend nostrums too fanciful for this matter-of-fact age.
Almost as well might a modern trainer be advised to get his
man fit by means of the terrific potions and purges upon which
Caunt and Belcher were brought into condition. In these days
we are partly too timid, and partly, I suspect, also too lazy, to
compound together some score of ingredients, more or less
poisonous or distasteful, and administer the product to an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">« 252 »</a></span>
unwilling patient in the rather sanguine expectation that it will
cure and not kill. A simpler treatment is preferred for producing
a result which is, after all, simple enough. The problem is to get
rid of that accumulation of fat which, in a time of almost complete
inactivity and overfeeding, has encumbered the heart and
liver and other internal organs of the hawk, and until it is
removed will make her dull, sluggish, and unmanageable. This
should certainly be done by medicine of some kind; and the
sooner it is done, after the flight feathers are fully down, the
better. Any attempt to reduce the superfluous fat, or to produce
an appetite by means of mere hunger, would be a great
mistake. The hawk would lose in strength and weight much
more than she gained in condition; and it would be a long
time before, by dieting alone, you could get rid of the mischief
which a couple of doses would almost put an end to immediately.
A simple purge and a simple emetic should be administered in
any case; and if the hawk is of a vivacious disposition, and has
not grown dull in the mews, this may be found a sufficient
physicking. For the former nothing seems to be better than
rhubarb. A convenient mode of dosing a peregrine is in the form
of a Cockle&rsquo;s pill, which may either be wrapped up in tissue paper
and pushed down the throat with a small stick, or concealed in
a tough morsel of meat which the hawk swallows bodily. A
merlin or female sparrow-hawk should not have more than half
one of these pills for a dose; and a jack or musket even less
than this. Goshawks may have more than the small hawks,
but not so much as a peregrine. For those who want a more
orthodox and time-honoured prescription, the following may
serve:&mdash;&ldquo;Take Aloes Cicotrine and graines of Filander, otherwise
called Stavesaker, and Cassia Fistula, as much of the one as of
the other, to the mountenance of a beane, togither, and when
ye have beaten it into powder put it into a henne&rsquo;s gut of an
inch long, tied fast at both ends: then convey it into hir in the
morning, so as she may put it over, and that must be after shee
hath cast, if she had any casting at al. Then set your hawke
by the fire or in the sunne, and feede hir with a quicke chicken,
or some other live warme meate two houres after.&rdquo; Even in
those days, however, it is plain that there were some misguided
heretics who rebelled against the long-winded precepts of the
esoteric school of hawk-doctors. "Neverthelesse, in stead of
the sayd aloes, ye may at youre discretion use common pilles,
such as Potecaries give men to make them loose-bodyed. And
many are of opinion that they be much better than that other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">« 253 »</a></span>
of aloes: for the pilles drive downward and scowre more strongly
and with greater effect."</p>

<p>It was an almost invariable rule with the old falconers to give
washed meat to a hawk after the moult. Many of them, indeed,
began to do so for about ten or fifteen days before the end of
the moult; and in the case of hawks which are now intended
to be flown as soon as possible, some preliminary steps of the
kind should be taken while the last feathers are growing fully
down. Washed meat is better than short rations in such a
case as this, where if you reduce the hawk&rsquo;s strength a little it
is no great matter as long as she does not get thin withal. But
the grand desideratum for a newly-moulted hawk is plenty of
carrying. The effect of this discipline upon a wild-caught hawk
has been already described; it is quite as magical, and still
more speedy in its results in the case of one which has become
wild in the mews. This is one of the good things of which one
cannot have too much. It is more than one man&rsquo;s work to
carry a single hawk as much as she ought to be carried when
fresh from the moult. If, therefore, there is not a man available
for each, let the one which is not being carried be pegged
down at her block if it is fine, or confined to the perch if it is
not, and provided with a tiring until there is someone who
can take her again on his fist. Tirings must be kept going
assiduously for the sake of the exercise, and for the first few
days all food that is not tirings should be given on the fist. In
short, the trainer must go through, with a moulted hawk, most
of the same processes, more or less modified according to the
character of the hawk, as he went through when first reclaiming
and making her to the lure.</p>

<p>Long-winged hawks are, of course, less troublesome to
reduce to orderly habits after the moult than sparrow-hawks
or goshawks. But then they require longer to get into wind.
For this purpose they must be called off to longer and longer
distances, and made to stoop hard at the lure. At first their
flight will be very heavy, and their desire to mount nonexistent.
After a minute&rsquo;s stooping at the lure they will have
their mouths open. It will perhaps be quite difficult to keep
them on the wing. But they must not be excused; and the
much-enduring trainer must have the patience to wait, swinging
the lure until it pleases my lady to come to it, and be keen in
the cause. It is altogether impossible to say how long it will
be from the time when she is taken out of the moulting-room
to the day when she can take the field once more. A haggard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">« 254 »</a></span>
dosed successfully, and dieted with lucky precision, may surprise
you by getting fit quite quickly, whereas an eyess which
you expected to bring into fettle in a few days may prove more
restive than she did when taken up from hack. There is luck
as well as skill in the treatment of each hawk. But carrying is
the <i>sine quâ non</i>; and the more a man carries his hawk the
better chance he has of observing how his treatment works, and
whether it should be modified in one way or another. The best
hawks, when well moulted, will often become even better the
next year; and there is no reason why a moderate or even a
poor hawk should not improve. Newly-moulted hawks should
not be brailed, nor allowed to be bareheaded in any place where
they are likely to bate. And of course great care will be taken
for some little time that they are not left in a damp or draughty
place or in the rain.</p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Virtue and Vice</span></p>


<p>Considering the great variety which exists in the character,
shape, size, colour, and appearance of hawks, it
may be easily supposed that they differ also in strength, speed,
and general capability. Perhaps the most notable of all points
in which they are distinguished is in the matter of temper.
Not only will the young birds from different eyries be unlike
in this respect, but the very same nest may produce one good-tempered
hawk, and another sulky; one bold and confiding,
another timid and suspicious; one vivacious and greedy after
her food, and another dull, sluggish, and indifferent about her
meals. Nor are these discrepancies the result, apparently, of
any different dieting or treatment. They exhibit themselves
in eyesses in the very earliest days of hack, or even before, and
usually continue for a long time, if not for life. No doubt a
good-tempered hawk may, by falling into bad hands, be
changed into a bad-tempered one; and some of those which
seemed worst tempered when first caught, or when first taken
up from hack, have by skilful management become quite
amiable and well-behaved. But the amount of care and art
required for the one sort is very different from that needed for
the other; and very few beginners will be likely to achieve
much success with a pupil which is thoroughly unmanageable by
nature. Sparrow-hawks, especially eyesses, are, as has already
been said, the most naturally untamable of the hawks usually
trained, with golden eagles a pretty good second; and the most
amenable are hobbies and merlins, which often seem as if they
rather liked being trained. Nothing more need be said here
about tempers than that with a troublesome pupil the trainer
must be extra patient and extra cautious, and be continually on
his guard against making a mistake. Hawks are from their
earliest days very good judges of character; and the more distrustful
and apt to take offence any one of them may be, the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">« 256 »</a></span>
determined must the falconer show himself to keep his temper
and exhibit a philosophic calm in his demeanour. The petulance
and restiveness which some hawks display vanish to an
extraordinary extent if such ebullitions of temper are quietly
ignored, and the offender, apparently wishing to make herself
designedly disagreeable, finds herself treated as if she had played
quite an amiable part. But the least sign of impatience or anger
on the part of the falconer is noted by an ill-conditioned hawk,
which thereupon seems to take a real delight in further aggravating
her imprudent or hasty master.</p>

<p>There is a whole world of difference between the breaking
of dogs and the breaking of hawks. The former know when
they deserve punishment, and actually expect it. They respect
a man for chastising them when they have done wrong, and
rather despise him if he ignores the fault. A hawk, on the
other hand, must never be punished, at least openly. To strike
a hawk, or rate her, is to forfeit at once her respect, and what
may be called her affection. A dog is a slave by immemorial
habit. He knows intuitively that he is dependent upon man
as a master. But the hawk, if she is worth her salt, knows
nothing of the kind. Turn her loose, and instead of starving or
begging, like the lost dog, she will well shift for herself. She
looks upon man as an ally rather than a master. She likes to
be treated as a friend and equal, rather than as a dependant
and a servant. Falcons, especially,&mdash;that is, the females of the
long-winged hawks,&mdash;are excessively proud, and even haughty;
and are mortally offended if any indignity is offered them.
But no matter what the hawk may be, the true policy is constant
kindliness, or at least the outward semblance of it&mdash;a policy
of rewards and not of punishments. Endeavour always to impress
upon her the idea that you are her very best friend; that her
chief enjoyments in life are due to your foresight and assistance;
that her food, her bath, the block on which she stands at
ease, the well-padded, sheltered perch, and, last but not least,
the opportunities for good and successful flights, are provided
by you. Then will she, in the language of the mediæval falconers,
rejoice at the sight of you, and like no place so well as
the fist. Then will she fly the better when your voice cheers her
on, and begin her meal more comfortably when you are standing
or sitting by. It is well to treat the ill-tempered hawk somewhat
as Mrs. Gummidge was treated, by making allowances.
Possibly she may some day surprise you by the display of
unsuspected virtues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">« 257 »</a></span></p>

<p>Passing from the mental to the bodily characteristics of
hawks, we find that occasionally two hawks are so alike that it
is almost impossible to distinguish them except by their jesses,
while others of the same kind and sex are so dissimilar that a
stranger may find it difficult to believe that they do not belong
to different species. There are, naturally enough, good and bad
hawks of every shape, size, and colour; and it would be very
rash to pronounce off-hand at the first sight of one that she
is worth more than any other. Nevertheless there are certain
peculiarities which are found in the average of instances, taking
many together, to belong more commonly to the best hawks,
and others which in the great majority of cases betray the bad
performer. These have always been remarked. They are
mentioned in many ancient books, written in many languages;
and there can be no doubt that after taking a good look at
several individuals, an experienced judge will pick out those
which he would prefer to possess if he had the choice. John
Barr told me upon this subject a rather pleasant story. He
was travelling southwards with a large number of hawks by
train, when at an intermediate station he met with the late
Prince Dhuleep Singh, who during a great part of his life was
a most enthusiastic and successful falconer, by whom Barr was
at one time employed. The Prince immediately inspected
the hawks, which, I believe, were the same that were afterwards
flown at Epsom, and in the course of conversation
pointed out in their order the hawks which were likely to do
best. The falconer mentally noted the selection thus made,
and afterwards found that it was accurately justified by the
result.</p>

<p>It is somewhat curious that the same characteristics which
in one species of hawks mark out an individual for admiration
or the reverse, are mostly found to serve a like purpose in the
other species. The following short remarks, therefore, unless
when otherwise specified, may be taken as applying to hawks in
general.</p>

<p>One of the very first points of which a critic will take note
is the foot of a hawk. Long toes are a great merit; and if they
are slender and well separated at the bases, it will be all the
better. Nor is there anything mysterious or unnatural in this,
for, the wider the area which the hawk&rsquo;s foot can cover, the
better chance she obviously has of catching hold with one talon
or the other of the quarry at which she strikes. Another
notable characteristic of the best feet is that they fasten themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">« 258 »</a></span>
naturally with a clinging grip to the object of which they
take hold, adhering so closely to a glove or any soft surface
that they seem almost to be glued or stuck to it, and can only
with difficulty be removed. In fact, the feet of some hawks,
when they have taken a firm hold, can only be got off by picking
the talons or claws out one after another with the hand.
The hawks which thus clutch are almost always good killers
in the field. Many falconers attach some importance to the
colour of a hawk&rsquo;s feet. Major Fisher declares that a nestling
peregrine with yellow feet is of little worth, and that the best
colour is lead-grey or greenish grey. Merlins in their early
days often have very pale feet, but some of the best of them,
when in high condition and fed daily on freshly-killed larks, will
put on a bright yellow and even a somewhat orange hue.
Bright colours are undoubtedly a sign of health, though they
may not be of strength, speed, or courage. The power which a
hawk has in her feet seems usually to be a sure indication of
corresponding vigour in the rest of her body.</p>

<p>The head of a specially good hawk is seldom big or round,
but wedge-shaped, narrowing from the back rapidly towards the
base of the beak, and rather flat on the top than dome-shaped;
and there is a prominent eyebrow, with a keen eye, very full
and bright. The shoulders come very high up, and are square,
as they would be called in a man. There is a great deal of
breadth in the upper back and in the breast, where the pectoral
muscles are situated, and these muscles may be felt by the
hand extending in a firm and ample bulk under the upper
points of the wings. The wings themselves have also an
appearance of size and strength, and each feather, if separated
from the next, is seen to have a broad web and stout shaft.
The same may be said of the tail feathers; but in these no
extra length is desirable. A short tail with plenty of strength
and solidity is better both for useful and ornamental purposes;
and a hawk with a long flexible train like a kestrel is not to be
preferred. A strong and fast hawk often folds her wings close
together, so that the points cross one another quite high up
over the tail. The nostrils of a hawk should be large, and the
beak short. No indication can be derived from the general
colour of the feathers, whether dark or light. As regards size,
there is a prejudice against big falcons and small tiercels; but
this does not hold good with regard to the short-winged hawks,
in which strength is often the chief desideratum. In the case of
peregrines a very large falcon is often clumsy; and the majority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">« 259 »</a></span>
of brilliant performers whose names have come down with
honour in the annals of falconry, were rather under than over
the average size. One of the most famous peregrines of this
century (Aurora by name) was of such an intermediate size
that her owner for some considerable time mistook the sex.
As for merlins, I do not remember any exceptionally big one
that was not particularly stupid and remarkably slow. A
specially small jack, however, is by no means invariably a
duffer.</p>

<p>So much for the appearance of hawks when standing at ease
on the block or perch. As soon as they are put on the wing
the task of distinguishing between them in point of merit becomes
very much more easy. The good hawk, when in good
condition, has a buoyancy in the air which is wanting in the
other. She flies with less effort, and as if she liked the exercise.
It seems as natural to her to fly in a slanting line upwards as
on a level. When she spreads her wings and sails along they
are held out to the very farthest possible extent, and kept
&ldquo;flat&rdquo;: that is to say, the tips are on a level with the back of
the head, or even a little above it. The fast flier does not
usually go along steadily through the air, moving, as a boating
man would say, on an even keel. On a windy day one wing is
often higher than the other, and her course swerves more or
less from time to time as she utilises or counteracts with a marvellous
art, not understood of men, the wayward pressure of
the disturbed air. If you have to choose between a hack hawk,
which makes her way along with regular beats of beautifully
even wings, like a heron or a dove, and one which hurls herself
forward in unexpected lines like a lapwing, by all means choose
the latter. Do not suppose that either lapwings or haggard
peregrines go crooked by accident, or because they know no
better. They can go straight enough if they choose, and will
do so if it happens to be their game to play. But just as a
skater, having only one skate on the ice, can go along if he
moves in divergent lines but not if he attempts to keep a
straight line, so it seems that by a sort of zigzaggy course
more pace can be got up than by mere plodding straight-forward
work. It is only after watching many hundreds of
flights that a man can hope even to begin to understand how
birds, both pursuer and pursued, man&oelig;uvre in the air, trimming
their sails, so to speak, so as to increase to the utmost,
the one the momentum of her stoop, and the other the speed
and suddenness of its shift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">« 260 »</a></span></p>

<p>Haggards, and the cleverest younger falcons, fly more with
the outer part of the wing than with the part nearest the body.
They work, in fact, rather with the joint which in the human
body is the wrist than by the movement of the whole arm from
the shoulder. The saving of labour so effected is obvious
enough. Only, in order to fly thus, the shoulders must be
thrown very far back, and the chest far more widely opened
than it is by most eyesses. When a hawk in stretching her
wings while standing on the block raises them far above her
head, or when, having bated off, she hangs down from the fist,
and, flopping with her wings, brings them so near together behind
her that they seem almost about to touch, be sure that
that hawk will fly better than one which carries her wings back
to about a level with her back only. It is in stooping at the
lure that you can judge best as to the merits of rook-hawks
or lark-hawks, while, of course, those of game-hawks and duck-hawks
are best tested by merely waiting on. In the latter and
more simple case that hawk will be preferred which goes up
quickest and to the highest pitch without raking away too far.
But note, in stooping to the lure, which comes at it with the
most headlong dash, and, having missed it, throws up soonest
and highest. In a hard flight that hawk is most successful
which after each stoop shoots up farthest, rebounding, as it
were, from the unsuccessful stoop, and so keeping the command
of the air, so that the quarry, even after the cleverest shift, still
finds his adversary on a higher level than himself. The best
hawks take great delight in stooping at the lure, and may be
cheered when they make a brilliant cut at it, which will increase
their excitement and zest. Sometimes, getting to a distance
from the falconer, they will rush in at their very best speed, and,
on the lure being twitched aside, will shoot up almost in a perpendicular
line; then, turning a sort of half-somersault, they will
come down in almost the same perpendicular line with the way
of the original impetus apparently still on them. A good
&ldquo;footer&rdquo; at the lure is usually a good footer at her quarry;
and good footing is one of the most deadly qualities any
hawk can possess.</p>

<p>Another remarkable thing about hawks is that those which
are the best-tempered are generally the boldest, strongest, and
best fliers. The reason is doubtless that bad temper proceeds
to a large extent from timidity; and timidity of mind is, in nine
cases out of ten, either due to bodily weakness, or at least connected
with it. By bad temper I do not, of course, understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">« 261 »</a></span>
mere anger. Some of the hawks which are the fiercest and
most furious when first taken out of the bow-net, prove the
easiest to reclaim, and the most obedient when trained. Sulkiness
is the worst of the natural vices, and it is unfortunately
common enough, not only in goshawks, which are notorious for
it, but in all kinds of hawks. Out of one nest I have had one
merlin which was almost the best-tempered and one which
was almost the worst-tempered that ever I saw. Eyesses are
more commonly sulky than passage hawks, and very often
display signs of this defect in the days of hack. Later on this
develops into some more specific vice, which will perhaps need
great care and patience to cure or modify. A short notice
of the vices most prevalent amongst hawks will not be out of
place, for the treatment of these disorders is almost as well worth
understanding as that of their bodily ailments.</p>

<p>Carrying is a fault with which the falconer will generally
first become acquainted. The word is ill-chosen, or rather ill-adapted
from the Norman &ldquo;charrier.&rdquo; It would have been better
if our ancestors had used such a term as &ldquo;bolting&rdquo; or &ldquo;lifting,&rdquo;
so that no confusion need have arisen between the word carrying,
as applied to holding a hawk on the fist, and as applied to
the hawk&rsquo;s action in taking up and flying away with her food.
However, be the name what it may, the practice is one to which
all hawks are more or less naturally addicted, although some in
a very much greater degree than others. Merlins and hobbies are
the most notorious offenders, and wild-caught hawks of the long-winged
kinds, though not always troublesome in this way, must
be prevented for a long time from developing this habit, or they
will infallibly become spoilt and lost. In the chapter on Training,
some directions are given for guarding against this predisposition,
and curing the mischief when it has already arisen.
But of all safeguards and remedies, by far the best is the habit
already referred to of constantly instilling into the hawk the
idea that your near presence is a thing to be desired, and not
disliked. If a merlin or any other hawk shows the least inclination
to carry when flying to the lure, or when being taken up
from it, I would, for a time at least, never go near her on any
occasion without taking a piece of food in the hand and giving
it to her. By this means in a few days she will look out for your
coming, and even listen for your step with all the pleasurable
expectation that other tame animals await the coming of their
feeder. And in taking her up have always on your hand a piece
of food which is either more tempting or at least more easily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">« 262 »</a></span>
devoured than that which she has in her foot. Let the tit-bit
be a &ldquo;mess of pottage&rdquo;&mdash;but not necessarily a big one&mdash;for the
immediate fruition of which the silly bird (as Turbervile calls
her) will barter away all the prospective advantages of a freshly-killed
partridge or a dainty pigeon. These latter have to be
plucked, mark you, before they can be eaten, whereas the bright
red morsel in your hand can be begun at once, without any such
trouble and delay.</p>

<p>In bad cases the vice of carrying may be corrected by a
rather strong remedy, which, like all other hawking devices, has
long been practised. Before resorting to it, see that the lure
which you are going to use, whether live or dead, is quite a light
one, but very firmly fixed up, so that no part of it, or no part
of the food with which it is garnished, can come away. Then
exercise your ill-behaved hawk in whatever way you prefer, and
let her ultimately get the lure and have it on the ground in her
foot. This lure will have a fairly long creance to it; and you
will keep hold all the time of the end of the line. Now, as your
hawk is on the ground with her food, begin to make in as if you
were approaching her after a real flight. You may, however, do
so much less cautiously. If she bolts with her meal, let her go four
or five yards, and then, with a sharp, sudden pull on the string,
twitch the whole apparatus out of her foot, and let it come flying
back towards you. What with the &ldquo;way&rdquo; that the hawk has
on her, and the suddenness of your pull on the string, the lure,
if properly fixed up, is bound to be jerked away; and my lady
will have to trouble herself to turn round and come back towards
you. But, of course, if you so arrange your lure that it will
part, and the edible portion of it remain with the hawk, while
the inedible comes back to you with the creance, you will have
done ten times more harm than you expected to do good. A
few lessons of this kind will often cure even a determined carrier.
But I have known merlins which were cunning enough
never to carry a light lure, knowing from experience that it would
be a mere waste of time, and yet, when they had taken a wild
lark, never doubted that they could make off with it if they
liked.</p>

<p>There is a special sort of carrying to which many long-winged
hawks are prone, and it is still more difficult to cure than the
practice commonly so called. A hawk which is much fed on
the fist, and little on the ground&mdash;especially on damp or uncomfortable
ground&mdash;will, after taking her quarry and killing it,
stand still on the ground, looking round with a restless air. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">« 263 »</a></span>
after a while, thinking, apparently, that the spot where she is is
not exactly the most convenient that could be found for a meal,
will get up, pelt in hand, and fly off in search of one more desirable.
This is done out of no feeling of mistrust or deliberate conviction
that her prize is likely to be taken from her. Thus the
fact that the hawk is quite tame, and even likes your company
at her dinner, is no safeguard against this vexatious habit. I have
known a jack-merlin which was frequently easy to take up, bolt
with a full-sized lark, and carry it, as if it weighed no more than
a feather, for nearly half a mile, searching for a place which was
good enough for my lord to picnic on, and disdaining several
flat mounds which lay in his way, and which would have formed
luxurious tables. The same hawk once carried a lark about six
hundred yards in one direction, and then, seeing no specially attractive
ground on that side, came back the whole way, and, flying
past at about fifty yards distance, settled on a rough, dirty heap
two or three hundred yards in a different direction. Had he
gone straight on for the same length of time in the original
direction, he would either have been lost and left out, or only
found by accident after a search of long duration. Sometimes
a hawk, too dainty to feed on the ground amongst prickly stubble
or tall, wet turnip-leaves, will go off with her quarry into a tree,
which is not a particularly comfortable dining-place, but which
she chooses to prefer. Mr. St. Quintin had a fine falcon which
persisted in this vice, until he actually got rid of her.</p>

<p>Other hawks, especially merlins, delight in going off to ricks
to plume and eat their quarry. There are not many trees in
places where the best merlins are flown, but there are always
plenty of ricks. Sometimes it is possible to climb these structures;
and many a time has the falconer, if a small man, been
hoisted up on the shoulders of some stalwart friend, or, if he is
stalwart himself, has given a back to some smaller man, or even
a man and a boy, ladderwise. Often, however, the rick is
unclimbable. Then what is to be done? for you cannot drag a
ladder for miles over the downs. The surest way is to carry a
long coil of string, with a bullet at one end. Stand at one side
of the rick on which your hawk is quietly and contentedly plucking
her victim; sling the bullet over the top of the rick, and as
nearly over the head of the hawk herself as your skill and the
wind will allow. Then, if you have an attendant, let him take
hold of the end of the string which has no bullet attached, and
which has not gone flying over the rick. If you have no companion,
peg down this last-mentioned end at a good distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">« 264 »</a></span>
from the rick. Then walk to the other side and pick up the
bullet. Pulling the string taut, drag it sideways, so that the
line scrapes along the top of the rick, and, coming to the hawk&rsquo;s
self-chosen dining-place, sweeps the whole affair, dinner, hawk,
and all, away. If the line should get entangled in the quarry,
so much the better; you can pull it down to the ground. If not,
the hawk may, of course, carry to another rick, and recommence
the same trick. But after repeated scrapings-off she generally
gets sick of the worry, and condescends to go down to the
ground.</p>

<p>A simpler and more unceremonious way of interfering with
the offender is to pelt her with clods of earth, or even flints,
until one of them either hits her or goes so near that she thinks
it advisable to decamp. I have known a hawk sit so stolidly
on a rick that though flints went within two inches on either
side of her, she took no notice, and went on eating. Others, old
offenders, know as well as their master what happens when they
go to rick. They would be rather surprised if they did not see
him bending down as he makes his way towards them, collecting
suitable missiles, and if he did not begin at once the familiar
sport of hawk-stoning. Such hawks may be called rick-hawks;
and they are about as trying to the temper as anything which
the falconer has to contend with. They are, however, not quite
so bad as tree-hawks. A falconer who is possessed of one of
these last-named treasures must add to his other accomplishments
that of being a good shot with a small stone.</p>

<p>What remedy there is for the hawk which carries out of pure
caprice it is not easy to say. In the first place, she must be habituated
to take some of her food on the ground&mdash;tirings anyhow,
which hitherto have perhaps been taken on the block or the
perch. Let them be fastened down by a peg or a weight, sometimes
on damp ground, sometimes even in prickly stubbles, so
that the over-dainty hawk may learn that eating on the ground
is not so bad after all. Then she ought to be flown sharp-set, so
that, being in a hurry for her food, she should be glad enough
to pluck it quickly and on the first place where she alights.
Give this sort of hawk as large a quantity of flying as ever you
can. Fly her, if you have the choice, at the most difficult quarry,
and in the most difficult places. Never mind so much if she
succeeds or not. It is better to lose a few rooks or partridges
than to lose your hawk. Fly her, therefore, as often and as hard
as you can. Never mind whether her score or her average is
bad. It is better to make a poor score than to think your hawk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">« 265 »</a></span>
is a good one when she isn&rsquo;t. A good deal of the restlessness
which makes a hawk flit about with her quarry is due to her
being short of exercise. If, therefore, you can make your hawk
fly more, either at the lure or in the field, than she has a mind
to, she is much less likely to go fooling about before attending
to the business of feeding herself. Of course it is very difficult
to do this, as twenty or thirty miles more or less is a mere exercise
canter for a peregrine. But many trained hawks get a great deal
less than this in a whole day.</p>

<p>There is a device which I should like to see tried with a
carrying hawk, but it requires some patience and good temper.
Get some stuffed birds of the proper kind, at which you mean
to fly your hawk; use them, unweighted, as lures, and when
the hawk has taken them and come down, let go the string
and approach her cautiously with food in hand as if you were
making in to her after killing a real bird. If she bolts, let her
go and make what she can of the stuffed bird. About twenty
minutes after you will have her back, furious, but perhaps less
ready to bolt away from the food in your hand&mdash;a sadder, but
possibly a wiser, hawk.</p>

<p>When a hawk, being carried on the fist bareheaded, ready
to be thrown off at quarry, keeps jumping off in a tiresome
way at nothing, ten to one she is not quite ready to fly.
Better put on her hood and let her wait for an hour or so, and
go on with another hawk, if you have one to fly, and, if not,
light a pipe. Hurry no man&rsquo;s hawks, not even your own.</p>

<p>It would be rather a misnomer to call soaring a vice. This,
which is one of the most beautiful accomplishments of the wild
falcon, is the natural mode of taking daily exercise. To see it
in perfection, look at a wild peregrine or a wild hobby&mdash;you
have there what enthusiasts describe as the poetry of motion.
All hawks, eagles and vultures soar by nature. It is their way
of stretching their wings, and of taking the air where it is cool
and fresh. Kestrels do a sort of humble soaring in search of
their food, and hobbies actually feed themselves, like swifts, on
the wing. To say, therefore, that a trained hawk which adopts
this orthodox method of keeping herself fit is thereby committing
a fault, is rather hard upon her. Nevertheless it is a very
vexatious habit, when over-indulged in, and, speaking from a
practical point of view, is not to be too much encouraged.
Hobbies, when flown in the middle of the day, even sharp-set,
will stay up constantly for a quarter of an hour and even more,
taking little apparent notice of the swung lure, or at the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">« 266 »</a></span>
striking at it without catching hold, or at least coming down
with it to the ground. To do them justice, they seldom go far
away, but often look as if they meant to do so, which, indeed,
they occasionally do, especially at migrating times. But a
peregrine which has taken to the soar often seems so engrossed
in the pleasant occupation as to forget all about mundane
affairs, and, sailing along in ever-widening circles, drifts farther
and farther down-wind, until the falconer, if unmounted, can
keep her in view no longer. Then, when she is beginning to tire
of her amusement, and to remember that she has, after all, a
crop to fill, she will very likely wing her way back to where she
last saw the falconer wistfully swinging her despised lure. But
what if an unlucky pigeon then heaves in sight? or if some
unsuspecting yokel puts up a partridge or a rook? There is
nothing to prevent her from having a shot at it: and, if she
kills, good-bye to my lady for that day. If you find her, it will
be more by good luck than anything else.</p>

<p>Hawks will go soaring because they are short of exercise,
because they feel hot from insufficient bathing, or because,
not being particularly hungry, they prefer a few minutes&rsquo; free
roaming about to immediately dining. Consequently a hawk
which has shown herself fond of the practice and slow at coming
to the dead lure, should be offered a bath whenever she is at all
likely to take it&mdash;once a day, in very hot weather. She should
have lots of flying and stooping to the lure, for, as she is fond
of the upper air, there is the less chance of her hanging about
round the falconer and spoiling her pitch. Finally, she should
be a bit keen after her food before she is put on the wing.
Soaring and waiting on are analogous things, or rather they
are the same with a difference. The best game-hawks, which
wait on mountains high, are soaring as they do so; that is, the
movement of the wings is the same, but the difference is that
the waiter-on is, as it were, anchored to a fixed point below&mdash;the
man or the dog, whereas the soarer is merely floating about
like a yacht which has no particular destination.</p>

<p>The vice of raking away differs only from that of soaring
away by the fact that it may be done at any height. Half-trained
hawks, before they have done any real work in the
field, are very apt to wait on in the wrong place. They know
as much as that they are expected to keep within sight of the
falconer, but not that they ought to be directly overhead; and,
through laziness, or because they prefer stooping at the lure
up-wind, they allow themselves to drift away to lee. Hardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">« 267 »</a></span>
have they come up level with the man than they at once fall
back on the wind, lowering their pitch, if pitch it can be called,
so that for all useful purposes their attendance is a mere sham,
and they might as well be on the falconer&rsquo;s glove. Repeating
this idiotic performance in the field, they are some hundreds of
yards to leeward, and at a low elevation, when the grouse or
partridge get up, and a stern-chase ensues, in which the quarry,
going up-wind, gets the best of it. For this annoying vice there
is no direct remedy. Experience may be expected to teach
the young hawk better. One plan is to let loose pigeons,
while the hawk is so waiting on, so that, after missing some,
by reason of raking and low flying, and perhaps catching others
when flying properly, she may understand at last how success
is to be had.</p>

<p>Checking is a crime to which we are not now so much
exposed as were the old falconers. Bird life is not so abundant
now, at least in England, that a hawk is confronted often with
an <i>embarras de richesses</i>, and leaves her legitimate quarry for a
stray bird of a different species. Eyesses, indeed, if kept to
one quarry, will often hardly be induced to pursue any other.
Passage hawks are more ready to check at birds which cross
their path. It would be rather too much to expect a haggard
falcon, which in her time has struck down birds of fifty different
kinds, to discriminate very nicely between a plump partridge
and a fat wood-pigeon when Providence threw either within
reach of an easy stoop. It is when a passage hawk has been
flown at rooks in the spring, and afterwards at game in the
game season, that there is the chief danger of checking. As
long as the sable quarry is alone attempted the risk is not
great. The hawk is flown out of the hood at quarry actually
in sight. It is only when that quarry has saved itself that the
temptation to check occurs, and at that moment there are, or
ought to be, lures waving near at hand. But encourage the
rook-hawk to become a game-hawk, and the case is altogether
changed. She has to go up alone, with nothing particular in
view, and wait aloft till the falconer springs her quarry. Moreover,
she knows now that rooks are not the only lawful game.
She is at full liberty to go at grouse; and, if grouse, why not
wood-pigeons and house-pigeons, gulls, or curlew? Why not
anything which is desirable, and which "tempts her roving
eyes"?</p>

<p>The besetting sin of the checking peregrine is the chase of
pigeons, wild and tame. Often, it must be admitted, this sin is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">« 268 »</a></span>
the outcome of the falconer&rsquo;s own action. Has he not himself
used a pigeon as a live lure? Has he not, when teaching his
pupil to wait on, let loose a pigeon with the express intention
that she should fly it? If he has never had occasion to do so
in training his passage hawk he has been exceptionally lucky.
As regards pigeons, it is generally pretty easy to break
peregrines of checking at them as soon as they have once
begun to fly at game. To achieve this feat get a good number
of very good pigeons&mdash;say a dozen, the faster the better; make
the hawk wait on at a short distance&mdash;say 600 yards&mdash;from
some covert in which the pigeon, if he can get as far, will be
safe from pursuit; then, while the hawk is waiting on that
side of you which is farthest from the covert, let go one of the
pigeons. The hawk will start, but the pigeon, if a good one,
will manage to make the covert; the hawk will throw up, and,
if all is well, come down to your dead lure. Repeat this performance,
always making as sure as you can that the pigeon
will save himself, until your pupil has got sick of the whole
business, and at last refuses to go for such disappointing quarry.
If you can put in, between whiles, an easy flight at a grouse or
partridge, and reward the hawk well upon it, the contrast will
be all the more striking, and she will begin to have a settled
conviction that game-hawking is capital fun, whereas pigeon-hawking
is a fraud. It is obvious that a somewhat similar
trick may be used with regard to other birds besides pigeons&mdash;flying
the hawk in impossible places at those which you don&rsquo;t
want her to pursue, and in easy places at those which you do.</p>

<p>Some hawks, which ought to know better, from laziness or
want of condition, will not remain on the wing, but go off, after
a few turns in the air, to a tree or to the ground, and there sit
waiting for the lure, or till the spirit moves them to stir. This
is disheartening conduct, quite unworthy of a ladylike or
gentlemanly hawk, and disgraceful in a falcon-gentle. Yet so
it is that many of these high-born dames, and not a few tiercels
also of noble birth, are so lost to a sense of their own dignity
that they give way to this degrading weakness, and demean
themselves to the level of a base-born short-wing. What is to
be done with them? Various devices have been tried with
varying success. In the first place, as the hawk behaves in an
ignoble manner, she cannot complain if you treat her in ignoble
wise. You may therefore ride at her as she sits on the ground,
and force her to get up, or you may throw clods at her, and
drive her out of her tree; but the surest plan&mdash;only it requires
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">« 269 »</a></span>
time and patience&mdash;is to let her cure herself. Light a pipe and
sit down in a comfortable place, if such there be, and leave the
sinner alone until the spirit does move her to stir. At some
time or other, varying from five minutes to five hours, she will
want the lure badly enough. Then let her come for it. Keep
her waiting on or stooping at the lure till she has had a good
dose of it, and if she goes off to perch again, wait again till she
will work for her living. Show her, in fact, that in coming to
the lure she is conferring no great favour on you, as she seemed
to imagine, but rather that the boot is on the other leg. Next
time it is more than probable that she will work a little rather
than go fasting, when she might have a good meal at once. If
you have time and patience to read her a few such lessons she
may gradually be brought to exhibit some activity. But give
her a dose as well. For liver has probably something to do
with the matter, as well as mere laziness.</p>

<p>A hawk which is hood-shy is a plague to you and to herself.
Very few hawks exhibit this vice except through the trainer&rsquo;s
fault. But trainers are not all good hooders; and a few bungling
and unsuccessful attempts at hooding will make even the best-natured
hawk hate the very sight of the hood. If, therefore,
the beginner is not clever at the art, let him practise on a
kestrel. Or, if he will have one of the better hawks, let him
get a skilful hand to break her to the hood. To hood a hawk
which is already broken is a comparatively easy matter; but it
is the nature of a hawk, as of any other creature, to dislike
being blindfolded, and the wonder is that hawks can be made
to submit to it as readily as they do. Occasionally a hawk has
such a rooted objection to the proceeding that the cleverest
man never succeeds in quite overcoming it. Vesta, already
mentioned, was hood-shy, though in good hands; but even then
the objection felt by the sufferer can only by a perversion of
terms be rightly called a vice. Hood-shyness, even in a
pronounced form, has often been cured, and, as has already
been said, a hood-shy hawk cannot be considered fully trained.
Whenever the hawk is difficult to hood, she should be handled
constantly, and the trainer should almost always have a hood
in his right hand. The actual condition of being hooded is not
disagreeable to many hawks&mdash;it is the indignity and discomfort
involved in the process of putting on the apparatus that give
rise to the trouble. The smaller the hawk, the more difficult she
is to hood; and the mischief is not only that the hawk&rsquo;s feathers
are in danger whenever she is hooded against her will, but also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">« 270 »</a></span>
that her temper is ruffled, and the relations between her and
her trainer become strained.</p>

<p>One of the most annoying errors into which a hawk can
fall, is a belief in her own vocal powers. No hawk ever has at
all a musical voice, and the exercise of it, even in moderation,
can quite well be dispensed with. Unfortunately, most eyesses
which have been taken very young from the nest develop quite
early in life a tendency to cry out. When there are several of
them together they often catch the habit from one another, and
becoming worse as their feathers come down, are by the time
they are ready to fly confirmed &ldquo;screamers.&rdquo; No cure has, I
believe, been discovered for this vice, except that of turning
them out to hack, which in nine cases out of ten proves successful.
I have several times known a family of hawks when first
turned out, to keep up for the first day or two an almost
incessant screeching, and yet I have taken up the same birds
at the end of hack completely cured. Generally, as soon as
a young hawk finds that she can expend all her superfluous
energy in flying about, and that no sort of attention is ever paid
to her eloquence, she gets tired of indulging in the weakness.
I know, however, of a case where hobbies too early taken were
actually lost at hack, and never came at all either to lure or
hack board, and yet continued to scream when quite wild for
at least more than a week afterwards.</p>

<p>Passage hawks, I believe, never scream. It is often supposed
that no wild hawks scream, and this, I think, is as a rule true.
But I have heard young wild kestrels scream for a few days
after they could fly, and one lot of wild merlins, though they
were fully summed, and had probably been already driven
away by the parents to shift for themselves, were what may
be called bad screamers. They would scream while soaring,
ten minutes at a time, and at such a height that the
sound could only just be heard. It is true that there were
trained merlins about at the time, and possibly they may have
been calling to them. It is quite a common thing for hawks
which are entirely free from the vice to call out when they see
another hawk unexpectedly. They will do it even when they
see their own likenesses in a looking-glass.</p>

<p>If the hawk, after being well hacked, still retains vestiges of
the bad habit, there is yet another chance. The flying and
killing wild quarry has often a magical effect in curing this vice,
which would seem, like some other malpractices, to be largely
the result of idleness. Still there are instances where, in spite of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">« 271 »</a></span>
all the advantages which an eyess enjoys, she will persist in
screaming. Some of them will go so far as to scream with the
hood on, though this is rare. As a rule a screaming hawk is
not a good performer. And she ought to be a very good one, in
order to make it worth the falconer&rsquo;s while to be plagued with
her. If you turn her adrift you may possibly, after a few days,
catch her again and find her cured; and if not, you will not
have suffered a very severe loss.</p>

<p>A still more disheartening fault is that of &ldquo;refusing.&rdquo; People
who know nothing at all about falconry are apt to suppose that
when once you have &ldquo;tamed&rdquo; your hawk, and can call her back
to you when you like, the only thing which remains to be done
is to walk with her into a field, show her a bird, and let her go.
That she should fail to pursue it is a contingency which does
not present itself to their minds. It is, however, unfortunately
one that constantly occurs, not only with eyesses, but also with
the boldest of wild-caught hawks. The novice gets his hawk
into a fine state of obedience. She will come a long distance
to the lure as soon as it is produced. But when the long-expected
day arrives for the first flight at a wild quarry, and
perhaps an expectant field of friends turns out to see the sport,
the wild bird is put up, the hawk is thrown off with a lusty
shout, and, without taking the smallest notice of her intended
victim, goes quietly on her way either to wait on for the lure
or to take perch in a pleasant spot. Even when hawks have
been entered, and have begun to fly in earnest, you cannot be
absolutely sure when you cast them off whether they will be
in the humour to do their best. They may begin the flight in
apparently faultless style, and go up bravely in the most orthodox
of rings after the ringing quarry. And then as they seem to
be getting on terms with their rook or lark, you may see the
fatal spreading of their wings, and have the painful conviction
forced upon you that they have shown the white feather and
thrown up the game. This vice&mdash;of &ldquo;flying tail to tail,&rdquo; as the
old falconers term it&mdash;is a most disheartening one for a beginner
to meet with; so much so, that some old writers regard such a
hawk as hopeless, and advise giving her away to a friend! I
have found it strongly developed in the only two hobbies I ever
tried to train; and a like result has, to my knowledge, followed
in several other instances. These hawks have made rings and
followed a wild lark up. But they have never taken even so
much as a bad one! I had a merlin which out of 41 flights
killed 40 larks. But the one occasion when she missed she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">« 272 »</a></span>
refused&mdash;or at least left the lark in the air. Possibly this was
because she was flown too soon after the last flight. But the
disgrace remains recorded against her name in the quarry-book.</p>

<p>To guard against this sad catastrophe you must encourage
your hawk; that is, you must keep up her courage, which is
the thing most severely tested in a ringing flight. You must
feed her well; yet keep her digestion in perfect order. And
you must strengthen her muscles by constant hard exercise.
It is not enough for her to go out and kill a couple of indifferent
rooks in two or three short easy flights. If there is not enough
good quarry&mdash;difficult quarry&mdash;to be found for her, you can
give her a good spell of stooping at the lure, or in the case of
a game-hawk, a long waiting on when the wind is highest, probably
about midday. She must have tirings galore. And if
she has refused once, fly her sharp-set the next time. Hawks will
refuse through being too fat as well as through being too lean.
Avoid, if possible, giving your best hawks bad quarry, or your
worst hawks any that are too good. The former may refuse a
specially good one because they are accustomed to take duffers,
and the latter may refuse because they have not yet gained confidence
in their own powers. Goshawks are capricious creatures;
they will refuse a leveret, and half an hour later fly well at a
full-grown hare. Other hawks may refuse if flown too early in
the day, and yet do a fine performance if tried again later on.
With a hawk that persistently refuses you should try every
remedy that your ingenuity will suggest as likely to inspire her
with a proper sense of her duty. Try feeding up; try flying
her very hungry. Physic her for liver, with one prescription after
another. And if all fail, give the hawk away, or, better still,
cast her loose in an open country where the keepers don&rsquo;t shoot
hawks. She then will have the choice between working and starving;
and she will very soon know how to decide the question.</p>

<p>The last, and in one way the most serious, vice which has to
be referred to, is that of &ldquo;running cunning.&rdquo; I do not think it
is common, if even it prevails at all among passage hawks; and
what there is to be said about it in the case of eyesses, has been
said in the chapter on Lost Hawks, <i>à propos</i> of Ruy Lopez.</p>

<p>We have thus a list of seven deadly sins, or so-called sins,
to which trained hawks are prone&mdash;carrying (better called lifting),
refusing, checking, perching, hood-shyness, screaming, and
running cunning. There are a few minor faults which hardly
amount to more than peccadilloes, and deserve only a passing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">« 273 »</a></span>
notice. Sometimes a hawk will keep bating off in a tiresome
way. This is when she is strong and well, but short of exercise,
and perhaps a bit feverish. The remedy is simply to hood her
up. It is far less annoyance to her to stand hooded than to
fatigue or worry herself by constant tugging and straining at
her jesses. But, as a matter of fact, for hawks to stand hooded
for any reasonable time is no annoyance to them at all, after
they have worn the hood a few times. If it were, we should
find that they suffered from it in health, strength, temper, or
somehow, which is not known to be the case. Merlins,
however, and male sparrow-hawks should be left unhooded
more than other hawks. And they must not be expected to
fly, like peregrines, immediately the hood is removed. The
same cause will induce hawks sometimes to pick and pull at
their jesses or at the covering of the perch, or even at the glove.
The remedy is to smear the jesses or perch or glove with aloes
or some bitter preparation, which is distasteful to them, but will
do no harm if they like to go on picking, but rather good.</p>

<p>It has been said (p. 32) that goshawks and sparrow-hawks
cannot be flown in casts (<i>i.e.</i> two of them together). This is on
account of the great probability that they will fight or &ldquo;crab.&rdquo;
There is also, in the case of long-winged hawks, some danger
that the like trouble may arise, especially if one or both of the
individuals thrown off has a bad temper of her own. Accordingly,
it is often well that each hawk intended to be used for
double flights should be first flown single a few times, until she
has become keen after her quarry, so that she may be too intent
upon the pursuit of it to quarrel with her colleague, when flown
double. But eyesses which have been well hacked and well
reclaimed are seldom addicted to this vice, which is still more
rare in passagers. As to the difficulties attending double flights
with merlins, see the remarks made at page 141; and as to
entering a young hawk with the assistance of an older one as
&ldquo;make-hawk,&rdquo; see pages <a href="#Page_113">113</a>, <a href="#Page_142">142</a>.</p>

<p>Some hawks, especially the wild-caught, will not bathe, but
after tasting the water in the bath, and perhaps making as if
they would go in, hesitate for a long time, and at last jump back
to their block. Some will not even &ldquo;bowse,&rdquo; or sip the water.
This is vexatious, for bathing undoubtedly improves the feathers
besides merely cleaning them, and keeps the hawks free from
parasites and from small attacks of feverishness. It also cleans
their feet, and makes them more hardy and robust. The best
plan in such cases is to see that the bath-water is never too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">« 274 »</a></span>
cold, to let a hawk which bathes well bathe in the sight of the
recusant, and to keep the bath on fine days within reach of the
latter. Such a hawk should also have her feet bathed now and
then while on the perch; and her beak should be kept clear of
any scraps or stains which may remain on it after feeding.
This wiping of the beak should, however, be done in any case,
if the hawk is not careful herself about feaking, or rubbing the
refuse off her mandibles.</p>

<p>Such is the rather long list of faults and vices. Let us not
end up the chapter with these, but hark back to the virtues, and
remind the reader that these are also great. Speed, courage,
mounting, and footing: these may be called the cardinal
virtues. Some hawks are born with some or all of them: some
achieve them; while upon others&mdash;well, they must be thrust.
The mode of treatment suggested in the preceding pages has
been found by long experience to be the best for developing the
good qualities in a hawk as well as for eliminating the bad.
Exercise and practice are the essential requisites. Nature is
then working on the trainer&rsquo;s side. Every hawk should be
made as often as possible to earn her food by hard work. And
every hawk should be encouraged to take a pleasure in her
work and a pride in herself. Exercise means speed; and speed
means success. With success will naturally come courage;
and excellence in mounting and footing is no more than the
inevitable result of proper practice in the right sort of flights.
All hawks in the wild state can kill many sorts of quarry. All
trained hawks, therefore, should be able to take at least one.
But if any man expects to become a falconer off-hand, he will be
disappointed. If he will begin moderately, with one hawk,&mdash;a
kestrel for choice,&mdash;and train her single-handed and completely,
he will soon be able to attempt much greater things.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Anecdotes and Adventures</span></p>


<p>If history is rightly called the practical illustration of philosophy,
then the quarry-book may be considered with
justice the tangible test of the falconer&rsquo;s theories. In many
cases a handful of experience is worth a cart-load of advice;
and a trainer who has lost a valuable hawk by treating her in a
bad way is not likely to forget in a hurry how bad that system
proved. Some entertaining and very instructive anecdotes may
be found scattered about in the old books, and more especially
in that of Charles d&rsquo;Arcussia, Lord of Esparron and Revest,
the Italian who was falconer to Louis <span class="smcap">XIII.</span>, and was honoured
by him with special favour. This treatise, which is difficult to
procure, is well worth perusal, not only for the descriptions contained
in it of remarkable flights, but for the sound sense of
many of the precepts given. Between the French and Italian
schools of falconry, as of fencing, a sort of friendly rivalry
existed; and the Italian, who had become a Frenchman, may
be said, in a way, to have represented both.</p>

<p>Coming to more modern times, a great many interesting
details of a historical and anecdotal kind are given in the works
already mentioned, published during the last fifty or sixty years,
beginning with the fine illustrated volume of Schlegel and
Wulverhorst, and including the new edition of Mr. J. E. Harting&rsquo;s
<i>Hints</i>. Without going over any of the ground covered by these
writers, I propose to add a few notes of actual experiences
within the memory of man. For most of these I am indebted
to the kindness of brother-falconers, who have supplied them at
some trouble to themselves, and whom I desire to thank heartily
for their friendly aid.</p>

<p>The powers of a trained peregrine are severely tested by a
first-rate house-pigeon, which is one of the fastest of flying
things, shifts well, and lives usually in fine condition, taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">« 276 »</a></span>
plenty of exercise. Adrian Möllen told me that a fellow-countryman
of his, vilipending his passage hawks which he was then training
for the campaign at herons at the Loo, offered to bet that three
of his own pigeons would beat any hawk Möllen could produce.
As the hawks were not Möllen&rsquo;s, and it is always quite on the
cards that a flight at a fast pigeon may result in the loss of
the hawk, the falconer had to ask leave before accepting the
bet. The king&rsquo;s brother, who then represented the Loo Club in
Holland, readily gave permission, and, I think, also offered to
pay if the hawk lost. Anyhow, a day was fixed, and a small
party assembled on the most open part of the Loo. The falconer
had stipulated that he should give the signal for the release
of the pigeons by the owner. His fastest falcon was then put on
the wing, and as she waited on Möllen gave the word. The
pigeon started; the hawk stooped, and, after a good flight, killed.
She was allowed to eat the brain, and the rest of the pelt was
thrown to the disconcerted fancier. A second pigeon was then
prepared. The hawk again waited on, and the signal was again
given. This time, however, the pigeon was taken at the first
stoop. &ldquo;Out with your third pigeon,&rdquo; cried Möllen, elated with
the double victory. But the countryman elected to pay, and
not to play. &ldquo;My third gold piece is lost anyhow,&rdquo; he sadly
remarked. &ldquo;Better pay my money, and save my remaining
pigeon, than find I have to lose both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The statement that a peregrine cutting down a grouse or
partridge without binding kills it &ldquo;stone-dead&rdquo; in the air, is
doubtless occasionally true. But to suppose that this is a common
occurrence would be a great mistake. Much more often
the partridge is stunned or dazed, the wing broken, or the back
or neck dislocated. But the force with which a game-bird comes
down when hit in the air is often very great, and enough in itself
to almost fatally bruise it. I have mentioned that a falcon of
Major Fisher&rsquo;s knocked down a grouse on fairly level ground
which, so great was the impact, rebounded from the earth, and
came down again fifteen yards from the place where it first fell.
Larks and other birds often dash themselves hard against the
ground in shifting downwards from the stoop, and bound up
again like balls.</p>

<p>Peregrines, when on their day and intent on killing, will
sometimes do more execution than would readily be believed.
Not very long ago a tiercel stooped at a covey, cut down a bird,
and threw up with the intention of descending to seize the victim.
But at the height to which his impetus had carried him up he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">« 277 »</a></span>
was right above the remainder of the covey, which was speeding
away at a short distance above the ground. Changing his mind,
therefore, the tiercel stooped again at one of the fugitives. He
cut this down also, and shot up again, likewise over the retreating
birds. For a second time the temptation proved too great,
and with a third stoop he took a third partridge.</p>

<p>John Barr was flying a ger-tiercel at a pigeon on Epsom
Downs, not far from Tattenham Corner. But the hawk was no
match for the pigeon, which evaded all his stoops. Instead, however,
of making off and thanking his lucky stars, this over-vain bird
stayed fooling around. Confident that the ger would not or could
not catch him, he sailed about, as if &ldquo;chaffing&rdquo; the big hawk and
challenging him to do his worst. At this moment an amateur
falconer came on the Downs by the Grand Stand, carrying a
falcon (peregrine) of by no means first-rate powers, but keen to
fly, and a good waiter on. Getting on to the open ground, this
gentleman threw off his falcon. But neither he nor his falcon
at first saw the pigeon, nor did the latter, intent on his game
with the ger, espy the distant foe. Thus the hawk had time
to get up some way before there was any suspicion on either side
that there was sport to be had. As soon as the falcon did cast
eyes on the inadvertent pigeon, she fortunately went up higher,
instead of starting in pursuit, as some eyesses would have done.
As she got to a pretty good pitch the pigeon at last became
aware that there was a second enemy in the field, or rather in
the air, and began to gird up his loins for flight in bitter earnest.
It was, however, now too late. The falcon towered far above,
and on the other side was the &ldquo;allied power,&rdquo; the ger. Another
ten seconds and the falcon came down with a will, threw up,
and at the second shot did for the too imprudent joker. The
amateur had the laugh at John Barr for some days afterwards,
having &ldquo;wiped his ger&rsquo;s eye&rdquo; with a peregrine.</p>

<p>Mr. Riley, who has had so much success with the short-winged
hawks, had thrown off a goshawk at a rabbit, which ran
past some old hollow pollard ashes. As he passed, out jumped a
fox and joined in the chase. This, however, boded no great good
for the hawk; and her owner raised so unearthly a noise that
reynard turned aside into the fence just as the goshawk took the
rabbit only two or three yards away. On another occasion a
rabbit was ferreted out by the side of a mill-pool. The ferret
was close on his traces, and he jumped deliberately into the pool
and swam across. Mr. Riley, who, like a good austringer, loves
fair play above all things, thought it a shame to fly a wet rabbit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">« 278 »</a></span>
and would not throw off his goshawk. However, when the
rabbit was on dry land he went so well that Mr. Riley let the hawk
go. The rabbit was caught; and when he was taken from the
hawk he was found to be quite dry! But whether his wet skin
had been dried up by terror or by the violence of his exertions, or
how else, is a mystery still unsolved. One day, having had bad
luck with partridges, Sir Tristram, owned and trained by the
same gentleman, was indulged with a pigeon. The big pointer
included in the party, and which was a great ally of the goshawk,
was at the time roaming about. As the hawk was pluming the
pigeon on the ground, the dog came romping along. But when
he had accidentally got within eight yards of Sir Tristram, the
latter left his meal, and, flying straight for the pointer, gave him
a good sound box on the ear, which sent him flying, the hawk
then returning, well satisfied, to his food.</p>

<p>Hawks have been known to kill quarry with a leash and
swivel still attached to their jesses. I have known a merlin
with a long leash on follow a lark up in rings several hundred
feet high, but she could not get on terms with him. What is,
however, perhaps still more astonishing, I have seen a merlin with
a whole dead lark in her foot pursue and strike down one that
was uninjured. I was with a friend in a very open place. Each
of us had a merlin to fly; and we walked different ways. My
chance came first; and the lark, after a flight of moderate length,
was taken under some open railings surrounding a dry pond.
Hardly was this flight over, and the hawk beginning to plume
her lark, when my friend&rsquo;s hawk started after a lark from the
opposite side of the pond. This lark happened also to make
for the same place&mdash;not that the railings were at all likely to
save him, but because he thought he could dodge round and
round the posts and under the bars, and so put off the fatal
moment. Larks seem often to think that any shelter is better
than none at all. Accordingly, round and round the rails this
second lark twisted and turned, passing sometimes within a
yard or two of the place where my hawk stood on her dead
lark watching the fun. The other hawk meanwhile made shot
after shot, but could not foot her quarry. &ldquo;She&rdquo;&mdash;that was
the name of my merlin&mdash;looked on more and more excitedly.
At last she could stand it no longer, but getting up, dead lark
and all, she mounted a bit and stooped. As the lark was diving
underneath a rail she hit it, first shot, with a resounding whack&mdash;not
with her feet, for they were both encumbered by the dead
quarry, but with the dead quarry itself! The lark was, of course,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">« 279 »</a></span>
not held, but projected forwards and downwards about three
feet to the ground; and before he could get up again the other
hawk was on him.</p>

<p>I was flying the same hawk in a very big stubble-field. A
lark got up&mdash;a ground lark, but a fast one&mdash;and away they
went, zigzagging along the surface of the field. They had
gone a long way, but not far enough to be out of sight, when
they both suddenly vanished. Running up, I found a deep
depression in the ground, where years ago a big pit had been
dug. This accounted for the disappearance. But what had
happened after that? If the lark had been taken, where was
he? And where was his captor? A small heap of dry sticks
at the bottom of the hollow was searched in vain. There
seemed to be no other hiding-place. At length a tiny hole
was seen&mdash;the mouth of a rabbit-burrow. And out of this, in
another half-minute, emerged the little hawk. The lark had
gone in, and she after it, but after some groping about in the
dark had failed to find the wily fugitive.</p>

<p>Only a few days afterwards the sister of this hawk started
after a first-rate ringing lark. Both of them went out of sight,
drifting at a great height towards a village a mile off. We ran
towards it at our best pace, fearing some disaster; but when
half-way to it saw the hawk coming back to the lure. Well,
we were glad enough that she had not killed in any cottage
garden, and, taking her back up-wind, went on with the day&rsquo;s
programme. As it was getting dark we had to walk through
the same village on the way home. &ldquo;Did you find your &rsquo;awk?&rdquo;
asked a cottager. &ldquo;What hawk?&rdquo; "Why, one of your &rsquo;awks
chased a lark into the passage o&rsquo; th&rsquo; public there, and would a'
caught &rsquo;im too, only there was a cat in the passage up and
grabbed the lark before the &rsquo;awk was on &rsquo;im; and the &rsquo;awk
looked as savage as thunder, and &rsquo;ooked it out, and went over
there where you come from."</p>

<p>Bee Cottage stands desolate in a very big valley, with hills
sloping gradually down to it on almost all sides. A ringing
lark, with a merlin close at his heels, got within reach of this
shelter from above the hillside to windward, and shot down to
it like a bullet, with the hawk a few yards behind. It was too
far to see from the hillside where, but he put in somewhere on
the premises. A diligent search, however, in hedge, bush, coal-shed,
and everywhere, led to no result. The door was shut and
locked: so were the windows. No one seemed to have lived in
the place for months. More searching, without any sign of lark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">« 280 »</a></span>
or hawk. Yet they undoubtedly came down here, and never
came out again. Outside, they could have been seen anywhere
for half a mile. At last I saw that there was a small pane of
glass gone in one of the downstair windows. Through that
opening I looked; and there sat my lady, with a fluffy heap
round her feet. So far, so good. But the room was full of bees,
some dead, and some alive! What was to be done?</p>

<p>Colonel Sanford owned, hacked, and trained a very first-rate
merlin called Orkney, which killed no less than ten larks in
a single day in single flights, thus surpassing Queen, which
took nine in single flights and one in double. This Orkney,
after a very long flight, put a lark into a flock of sheep. But
she marked the exact spot, underneath a sheep, where the
fugitive stopped, and, taking perch on a neighbouring wether,
kept her eye on the place. The sheep moved on, leaving the
ground clear; and Orkney jumped as nearly as she could guess
on the right spot. She failed, however, to grab the lark, which
got up again and promptly took refuge under another sheep.
Again the little hawk took stand on the next bleater, marking
still more carefully the hiding-place of the quarry. Again the
animals walked on, and this time perseverance was rewarded,
and the lark was carried in triumph from the woolly protectors
which had so nearly saved him. The same hawk once drove a
lark into a small hole where she could see nothing of him but
the tail. After some reflection she put in her beak and grasped
steadily the feathers of the tail. Then with an unhurried pull
she drew him far enough out of the hole to be able to get at
him with her foot.</p>

<p>The best hawk I ever had was the merlin Eva. She was
never beaten in fair flight by any lark during the whole of the
moulting season; and she killed one (fully moulted, of course)
as late as 7th November. One day she mounted an immense
height after a ringing lark, bested him, and had had three shots,
when a wild merlin joined in. After this the two hawks flew
in concert just as if they had been trained in the same stable.
Stoop for stoop, in regular alternations, they worked this plucky
lark down by a few yards at each shift, neither I nor James Retford,
who was running with me, being able to distinguish which
was which. At last, when the lark had been driven down to
within about 300 feet of the ground, there were two fine stoops
in quick succession, the second of which was fatal. &ldquo;Which is
it?&rdquo; I gasped, inquiring of the experienced falconer. &ldquo;The wild
one,&rdquo; I think, he answered, sinking down breathless on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">« 281 »</a></span>
down. It was not, though. The wild hawk, furious, turned
away, and, to vent her rage, made a savage shot at the ears of
a hare which happened at the moment to be running along the
valley; while Eva, descending slowly on the side of the down,
had just recovered her breath by the time I got up.</p>

<p>On a second occasion Eva was almost equally high, and still
ringing to get above her lark, when she suddenly spread her
wings and swerved in her course. At the same moment Major
Fisher, who was out on horseback, shouted, &ldquo;The wild merlin!&rdquo;
But this time Eva was not going to join in any duet. The wild
hawk had come up on a much lower level than the trained one
had attained, possibly thinking that when Eva had done the
hard work of the early stoops she might cut in and reap the
benefit. At any rate, Eva was not to be so dealt with. Poising
herself like a falcon when the grouse get up, she turned over and
came down with every ounce of force she could muster right at
the interloper. Of course she did not hit her. The two went
off, stooping at one another, and were soon out of sight. Major
Fisher rode after them, field-glass in hand, predicting that the
wild hawk would chase Eva away. But in less than two
minutes he espied a merlin coming back; and the trained hawk,
in one long slanting fall from out of sight, descended daintily
upon the lure held in her owner&rsquo;s fist.</p>

<p>Queen was a first-rate merlin&mdash;sister of Jubilee, and also,
though younger by a year, of Tagrag. She started at a ringing
lark in a very open place, and it was a case of hard running,
for there were no markers out. Before half a mile was covered
they were over a sloping brow. By a desperate spurt I reached
the ridge, when the hawk was in sight again. The ground
sloped downwards for half a mile more; and in the valley, far
away, was a sheep-fold, with sheep, shepherd, and a dog. For
this fold the quarry was of course making. Anyhow, there
would be the shepherd to mark; and a shout might reach even
his rather inattentive ear. It was too far to see the hawk as
she stooped; but when she threw up, and when she turned over,
the sunlight caught the under-surface of her wing or tail, and
showed where she was; and the last gleam came from painfully
near the sheep. The running was easier downhill; and soon
the shepherd was within hail. &ldquo;Where is the hawk?&rdquo; Reply
inaudible up-wind. Thirty yards farther on the words could
be heard, &ldquo;Gone back where you come from.&rdquo; Then, of course,
she had lost the lark&mdash;rather luckily, having regard to the dog&mdash;and
had passed me unnoticed, flying low. Well, the hill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">« 282 »</a></span>
must be mounted again and the lure kept going. There, too,
is surely a glimpse of Queen herself, just vanishing over the
sky-line. She will be gone back to the place where her sister
is pegged down. Ten minutes&rsquo; walking and running, and this
place is in sight. But no sign of Queen. Five minutes&rsquo; more
luring, and at last a hawk comes in sight,&mdash;not making
directly for the lure, however, but hanging about and keeping
well away. Strange conduct in this merlin, which rather liked
the lure! And now she begins waiting on, and soaring,&mdash;a rare
amusement with this very practical-minded hawk. Round and
round, farther and farther down-wind, away we go, Queen
hardly now even looking at the lure. Soon the hawk is too
far to keep in sight without very fast running. Had I been
fresh, probably I should have run hard. But I was far from
fresh. And the behaviour of Queen was very queer.</p>

<p>Suddenly a new idea evolved itself. What if it was not
Queen at all, but a wild merlin? It might be well to search a
bit, anyhow, where Queen was last seen in her own undoubted
personality. Searching, therefore, became the word&mdash;rather late
in the day. And on a patch of new-ploughed fallow, barely
distinguishable from the clods of brown earth, there stood my
lady, with a litter of feathers round her, calmly eating the
remains of a lark, and wondering what on earth I was about.
She had taken the lark with that very last stoop for which I
had seen her turn over, at the very edge of the sheep-fold, and,
not liking the proximity of the dog, had carried her booty well
away, taking the direction from which she had come, as the dog
was on the other side. The wild hawk had been too late to
join in the flight, but had seen the kill, and had come down
perhaps with a vague idea of robbing Queen. Thinking better
of any such attempt&mdash;which would not have ended pleasantly&mdash;she
had been inquisitive as to the lure, and thinking the whole
affair rather singular, had soared about, waiting to see what
would happen next.</p>

<p>Ruy Lopez was a jack which rather fancied himself, and had
something in his style of flying of the tactics of a haggard
peregrine. That is, he would start in a different direction from
the quarry, so that strangers would suppose he had no designs
upon it, and afterwards turn and make an immensely long stoop
at it all across the air. But on one occasion he had a very close
personal experience of the stooping of peregrines. He was lost;
and no one knew anything of his whereabouts. It so happened
that James and William Retford, Major Fisher&rsquo;s falconers, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">« 283 »</a></span>
out with a pointer and a falcon named Black Lady. The dog
stood, but in a queer and rather doubtful way; and Black Lady
was thrown off. When she had got to her pitch the men ran
in. But instead of partridges, there got up out of the swedes
the unexpected shape of Ruy Lopez, he having been quietly discussing
there a lark which he had just killed. Down came the
falcon, better pleased, as hawks are, at such a chase than one at
a mere partridge. And the falconers describe the flight as
beyond measure exciting. They thought each stoop would be
the last, and declared that the small hawk saved himself several
times by a hair&rsquo;s-breadth. At length, however, he got in under
a stook of wheat. No doubt the falconers thought it was a near
thing. And possibly it was; but as far as my own experience
goes, trained peregrines cannot get within a yard of a good
trained merlin. I have seen them try; and the merlin has
shifted with contemptuous ease. Major Fisher, however, as
already mentioned, had a tiercel which made it very hot for a
wild merlin, and, as he thinks, very nearly caught it. I have
seen one of his eyess tiercels take a kestrel with apparent ease
at the first stoop. But that is certainly quite a different matter.</p>

<p>The already long list which has been given of mischances
and maladies which beset trained hawks is even yet not complete.
In India the wild eagles are a serious nuisance, coming
down from the high altitudes at which they soar, and obliging
the hawks to shift for their own safety just when they are
expected and expecting to give a good account of their own
quarry. In England, hawks which are pegged out in any but
a quiet private place are exposed to the attack of any chance
dog. I do not know that cats will deliberately attack even the
smallest jack, either by day or by night. But a tame cat which
had gone mad once made an onslaught on the trained peregrines
belonging to the O. H. C., and with such ferocity that quite a
large number of them died of their wounds. Mr. A. W. Reed,
an experienced and enthusiastic amateur falconer, had some very
valuable hawks, including a ger and some Eastern varieties,
pegged out on a lawn in Essex. A neighbouring householder,
being troubled by sparrows, laid down poisoned grain. The
sparrows took the grain, and, dying as they flew over the place
where the hawks were, fell down on the ground near the blocks.
Of course the hawks ate them; and, equally of course, the hawks
were poisoned. And, advice being taken, it was considered
useless to take proceedings against the offender.</p>

<p>Cases of deliberate hawk-murder are now punishable by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">« 284 »</a></span>
law. All falconers are highly indebted to Mr. E. C. Pinckney
for having demonstrated this fact conclusively in a local tribunal.
He extracted £10 in damages from a neighbour who had shot
at and killed his game-hawk, although the latter set up the
usual defence, pretending that he was unaware that the hawk
was a tame one. The judge held that, as he was aware that
his neighbour kept trained hawks, if he shot at one, he did so at
his own peril, just as a man would who shot at a house-pigeon
or escaped parrot. More lately still, Mr. A. W. Reed has been
awarded £5 at the Kingston County Court as damages from a
neighbour who had wilfully shot his trained peregrine. The
precedents, as far as they go, are most valuable. Unfortunately
they do not, of course, go very far. But a falconer will be well
advised, having regard to them, to send notices in registered
letters, when going into any district, to all such people as are
likely to prove mischievous.</p>
